There was no possibility of taking a walk that day .
We had been wandering , indeed , in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning ; but since dinner ( Mrs. Reed , when there was no company , dined early ) the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre , and a rain so penetrating , that further out-door exercise was now out of the question .
I was glad of it : I never liked long walks , especially on chilly afternoons : dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight , with nipped fingers and toes , and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie , the nurse , and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to Eliza , John , and Georgiana Reed .
The said Eliza , John , and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama in the drawing-room : she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside , and with her darlings about her ( for the time neither quarrelling nor crying ) looked perfectly happy .
Me , she had dispensed from joining the group ; saying , " She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a distance ; but that until she heard from Bessie , and could discover by her own observation , that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a more sociable and childlike disposition , a more attractive and sprightly manner—something lighter , franker , more natural , as it were—she really must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented , happy , little children .
" " What does Bessie say I have done ?
" I asked .
" Jane , I don 't like cavillers or questioners ; besides , there is something truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that manner .
Be seated somewhere ; and until you can speak pleasantly , remain silent .
" A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room , I slipped in there .
It contained a bookcase : I soon possessed myself of a volume , taking care that it should be one stored with pictures .
I mounted into the window- seat : gathering up my feet , I sat cross-legged , like a Turk ; and , having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close , I was shrined in double retirement .
Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand ; to the left were the clear panes of glass , protecting , but not separating me from the drear November day .
At intervals , while turning over the leaves of my book , I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon .
Afar , it offered a pale blank of mist and cloud ; near a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat shrub , with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and lamentable blast .
I returned to my book—Bewick 's History of British Birds : the letterpress thereof I cared little for , generally speaking ; and yet there were certain introductory pages that , child as I was , I could not pass quite as a blank .
They were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl ; of " the solitary rocks and promontories " by them only inhabited ; of the coast of Norway , studded with isles from its southern extremity , the Lindeness , or Naze , to the North Cape— " Where the Northern Ocean , in vast whirls , Boils round the naked , melancholy isles Of farthest Thule ; and the Atlantic surge Pours in among the stormy Hebrides .
" Nor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of Lapland , Siberia , Spitzbergen , Nova Zembla , Iceland , Greenland , with " the vast sweep of the Arctic Zone , and those forlorn regions of dreary space , —that reservoir of frost and snow , where firm fields of ice , the accumulation of centuries of winters , glazed in Alpine heights above heights , surround the pole , and concentre the multiplied rigours of extreme cold .
" Of these death-white realms I formed an idea of my own : shadowy , like all the half-comprehended notions that float dim through children 's brains , but strangely impressive .
The words in these introductory pages connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes , and gave significance to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow and spray ; to the broken boat stranded on a desolate coast ; to the cold and ghastly moon glancing through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking .
I cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard , with its inscribed headstone ; its gate , its two trees , its low horizon , girdled by a broken wall , and its newly-risen crescent , attesting the hour of eventide .
The two ships becalmed on a torpid sea , I believed to be marine phantoms .
The fiend pinning down the thief 's pack behind him , I passed over quickly : it was an object of terror .
So was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock , surveying a distant crowd surrounding a gallows .
Each picture told a story ; mysterious often to my undeveloped understanding and imperfect feelings , yet ever profoundly interesting : as interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes narrated on winter evenings , when she chanced to be in good humour ; and when , having brought her ironing-table to the nursery hearth , she allowed us to sit about it , and while she got up Mrs. Reed 's lace frills , and crimped her nightcap borders , fed our eager attention with passages of love and adventure taken from old fairy tales and other ballads ; or ( as at a later period I discovered ) from the pages of Pamela , and Henry , Earl of Moreland .
With Bewick on my knee , I was then happy : happy at least in my way .
I feared nothing but interruption , and that came too soon .
The breakfast- room door opened .
" Boh ! Madam Mope !" cried the voice of John Reed ; then he paused : he found the room apparently empty .
" Where the dickens is she !" he continued . " Lizzy ! Georgy !
( calling to his sisters ) Joan is not here : tell mama she is run out into the rain—bad animal !
" " It is well I drew the curtain , " thought I ; and I wished fervently he might not discover my hiding-place : nor would John Reed have found it out himself ; he was not quick either of vision or conception ; but Eliza just put her head in at the door , and said at once— " She is in the window-seat , to be sure , Jack .
" And I came out immediately , for I trembled at the idea of being dragged forth by the said Jack .
" What do you want ?
" I asked , with awkward diffidence .
" Say , ' What do you want , Master Reed ? ' " was the answer .
" I want you to come here ; " and seating himself in an arm-chair , he intimated by a gesture that I was to approach and stand before him .
John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old ; four years older than I , for I was but ten : large and stout for his age , with a dingy and unwholesome skin ; thick lineaments in a spacious visage , heavy limbs and large extremities .
He gorged himself habitually at table , which made him bilious , and gave him a dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks .
He ought now to have been at school ; but his mama had taken him home for a month or two , " on account of his delicate health .
" Mr. Miles , the master , affirmed that he would do very well if he had fewer cakes and sweetmeats sent him from home ; but the mother 's heart turned from an opinion so harsh , and inclined rather to the more refined idea that John 's sallowness was owing to over-application and , perhaps , to pining after home .
John had not much affection for his mother and sisters , and an antipathy to me .
He bullied and punished me ; not two or three times in the week , nor once or twice in the day , but continually : every nerve I had feared him , and every morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he came near .
There were moments when I was bewildered by the terror he inspired , because I had no appeal whatever against either his menaces or his inflictions ; the servants did not like to offend their young master by taking my part against him , and Mrs. Reed was blind and deaf on the subject : she never saw him strike or heard him abuse me , though he did both now and then in her very presence , more frequently , however , behind her back .
Habitually obedient to John , I came up to his chair : he spent some three minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he could without damaging the roots : I knew he would soon strike , and while dreading the blow , I mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance of him who would presently deal it .
I wonder if he read that notion in my face ; for , all at once , without speaking , he struck suddenly and strongly .
I tottered , and on regaining my equilibrium retired back a step or two from his chair .
" That is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since , " said he , " and for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains , and for the look you had in your eyes two minutes since , you rat !
" Accustomed to John Reed 's abuse , I never had an idea of replying to it ; my care was how to endure the blow which would certainly follow the insult .
" What were you doing behind the curtain ?
" he asked .
" I was reading .
" " Show the book .
" I returned to the window and fetched it thence .
" You have no business to take our books ; you are a dependent , mama says ; you have no money ; your father left you none ; you ought to beg , and not to live here with gentlemen 's children like us , and eat the same meals we do , and wear clothes at our mama 's expense .
Now , I 'll teach you to rummage my bookshelves : for they _ are _ mine ; all the house belongs to me , or will do in a few years .
Go and stand by the door , out of the way of the mirror and the windows .
" I did so , not at first aware what was his intention ; but when I saw him lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it , I instinctively started aside with a cry of alarm : not soon enough , however ; the volume was flung , it hit me , and I fell , striking my head against the door and cutting it .
The cut bled , the pain was sharp : my terror had passed its climax ; other feelings succeeded .
" Wicked and cruel boy !
" I said .
" You are like a murderer—you are like a slave-driver—you are like the Roman emperors !
" I had read Goldsmith 's History of Rome , and had formed my opinion of Nero , Caligula , & c .
Also I had drawn parallels in silence , which I never thought thus to have declared aloud .
" What ! what !
" he cried .
" Did she say that to me ?
Did you hear her , Eliza and Georgiana ?
Won 't I tell mama ? but first— " He ran headlong at me : I felt him grasp my hair and my shoulder : he had closed with a desperate thing .
I really saw in him a tyrant , a murderer .
I felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down my neck , and was sensible of somewhat pungent suffering : these sensations for the time predominated over fear , and I received him in frantic sort .
I don 't very well know what I did with my hands , but he called me " Rat !
Rat !
" and bellowed out aloud .
Aid was near him : Eliza and Georgiana had run for Mrs. Reed , who was gone upstairs : she now came upon the scene , followed by Bessie and her maid Abbot .
We were parted : I heard the words— " Dear ! dear !
What a fury to fly at Master John !
" " Did ever anybody see such a picture of passion !
" Then Mrs. Reed subjoined— " Take her away to the red-room , and lock her in there .
" Four hands were immediately laid upon me , and I was borne upstairs .
I resisted all the way : a new thing for me , and a circumstance which greatly strengthened the bad opinion Bessie and Miss Abbot were disposed to entertain of me .
The fact is , I was a trifle beside myself ; or rather _ out _ of myself , as the French would say : I was conscious that a moment 's mutiny had already rendered me liable to strange penalties , and , like any other rebel slave , I felt resolved , in my desperation , to go all lengths .
" Hold her arms , Miss Abbot : she 's like a mad cat .
" " For shame ! for shame !
" cried the lady 's-maid .
" What shocking conduct , Miss Eyre , to strike a young gentleman , your benefactress 's son !
Your young master .
" " Master !
How is he my master ?
Am I a servant ?
" " No ; you are less than a servant , for you do nothing for your keep .
There , sit down , and think over your wickedness .
" They had got me by this time into the apartment indicated by Mrs. Reed , and had thrust me upon a stool : my impulse was to rise from it like a spring ; their two pair of hands arrested me instantly .
" If you don 't sit still , you must be tied down , " said Bessie .
" Miss Abbot , lend me your garters ; she would break mine directly .
" Miss Abbot turned to divest a stout leg of the necessary ligature .
This preparation for bonds , and the additional ignominy it inferred , took a little of the excitement out of me .
" Don 't take them off , " I cried ; " I will not stir .
" In guarantee whereof , I attached myself to my seat by my hands .
" Mind you don 't , " said Bessie ; and when she had ascertained that I was really subsiding , she loosened her hold of me ; then she and Miss Abbot stood with folded arms , looking darkly and doubtfully on my face , as incredulous of my sanity .
" She never did so before , " at last said Bessie , turning to the Abigail .
" But it was always in her , " was the reply .
" I 've told Missis often my opinion about the child , and Missis agreed with me .
She 's an underhand little thing : I never saw a girl of her age with so much cover .
" Bessie answered not ; but ere long , addressing me , she said— " You ought to be aware , Miss , that you are under obligations to Mrs. Reed : she keeps you : if she were to turn you off , you would have to go to the poorhouse .
" I had nothing to say to these words : they were not new to me : my very first recollections of existence included hints of the same kind .
This reproach of my dependence had become a vague sing-song in my ear : very painful and crushing , but only half intelligible .
Miss Abbot joined in— " And you ought not to think yourself on an equality with the Misses Reed and Master Reed , because Missis kindly allows you to be brought up with them .
They will have a great deal of money , and you will have none : it is your place to be humble , and to try to make yourself agreeable to them .
" " What we tell you is for your good , " added Bessie , in no harsh voice , " you should try to be useful and pleasant , then , perhaps , you would have a home here ; but if you become passionate and rude , Missis will send you away , I am sure .
" " Besides , " said Miss Abbot , " God will punish her : He might strike her dead in the midst of her tantrums , and then where would she go ?
Come , Bessie , we will leave her : I wouldn 't have her heart for anything .
Say your prayers , Miss Eyre , when you are by yourself ; for if you don 't repent , something bad might be permitted to come down the chimney and fetch you away .
" They went , shutting the door , and locking it behind them .
The red-room was a square chamber , very seldom slept in , I might say never , indeed , unless when a chance influx of visitors at Gateshead Hall rendered it necessary to turn to account all the accommodation it contained : yet it was one of the largest and stateliest chambers in the mansion .
A bed supported on massive pillars of mahogany , hung with curtains of deep red damask , stood out like a tabernacle in the centre ; the two large windows , with their blinds always drawn down , were half shrouded in festoons and falls of similar drapery ; the carpet was red ; the table at the foot of the bed was covered with a crimson cloth ; the walls were a soft fawn colour with a blush of pink in it ; the wardrobe , the toilet-table , the chairs were of darkly polished old mahogany .
Out of these deep surrounding shades rose high , and glared white , the piled- up mattresses and pillows of the bed , spread with a snowy Marseilles counterpane .
Scarcely less prominent was an ample cushioned easy-chair near the head of the bed , also white , with a footstool before it ; and looking , as I thought , like a pale throne .
This room was chill , because it seldom had a fire ; it was silent , because remote from the nursery and kitchen ; solemn , because it was known to be so seldom entered .
The house-maid alone came here on Saturdays , to wipe from the mirrors and the furniture a week 's quiet dust : and Mrs. Reed herself , at far intervals , visited it to review the contents of a certain secret drawer in the wardrobe , where were stored divers parchments , her jewel-casket , and a miniature of her deceased husband ; and in those last words lies the secret of the red-room—the spell which kept it so lonely in spite of its grandeur .
Mr. Reed had been dead nine years : it was in this chamber he breathed his last ; here he lay in state ; hence his coffin was borne by the undertaker 's men ; and , since that day , a sense of dreary consecration had guarded it from frequent intrusion .
My seat , to which Bessie and the bitter Miss Abbot had left me riveted , was a low ottoman near the marble chimney-piece ; the bed rose before me ; to my right hand there was the high , dark wardrobe , with subdued , broken reflections varying the gloss of its panels ; to my left were the muffled windows ; a great looking-glass between them repeated the vacant majesty of the bed and room .
I was not quite sure whether they had locked the door ; and when I dared move , I got up and went to see .
Alas ! yes : no jail was ever more secure .
Returning , I had to cross before the looking- glass ; my fascinated glance involuntarily explored the depth it revealed .
All looked colder and darker in that visionary hollow than in reality : and the strange little figure there gazing at me , with a white face and arms specking the gloom , and glittering eyes of fear moving where all else was still , had the effect of a real spirit : I thought it like one of the tiny phantoms , half fairy , half imp , Bessie 's evening stories represented as coming out of lone , ferny dells in moors , and appearing before the eyes of belated travellers .
I returned to my stool .
Superstition was with me at that moment ; but it was not yet her hour for complete victory : my blood was still warm ; the mood of the revolted slave was still bracing me with its bitter vigour ; I had to stem a rapid rush of retrospective thought before I quailed to the dismal present .
All John Reed 's violent tyrannies , all his sisters ' proud indifference , all his mother 's aversion , all the servants ' partiality , turned up in my disturbed mind like a dark deposit in a turbid well .
Why was I always suffering , always browbeaten , always accused , for ever condemned ?
Why could I never please ?
Why was it useless to try to win any one 's favour ?
Eliza , who was headstrong and selfish , was respected .
Georgiana , who had a spoiled temper , a very acrid spite , a captious and insolent carriage , was universally indulged .
Her beauty , her pink cheeks and golden curls , seemed to give delight to all who looked at her , and to purchase indemnity for every fault .
John no one thwarted , much less punished ; though he twisted the necks of the pigeons , killed the little pea-chicks , set the dogs at the sheep , stripped the hothouse vines of their fruit , and broke the buds off the choicest plants in the conservatory : he called his mother " old girl , " too ; sometimes reviled her for her dark skin , similar to his own ; bluntly disregarded her wishes ; not unfrequently tore and spoiled her silk attire ; and he was still " her own darling .
" I dared commit no fault : I strove to fulfil every duty ; and I was termed naughty and tiresome , sullen and sneaking , from morning to noon , and from noon to night .
My head still ached and bled with the blow and fall I had received : no one had reproved John for wantonly striking me ; and because I had turned against him to avert farther irrational violence , I was loaded with general opprobrium .
" Unjust ! —unjust !
" said my reason , forced by the agonising stimulus into precocious though transitory power : and Resolve , equally wrought up , instigated some strange expedient to achieve escape from insupportable oppression—as running away , or , if that could not be effected , never eating or drinking more , and letting myself die .
What a consternation of soul was mine that dreary afternoon !
How all my brain was in tumult , and all my heart in insurrection !
Yet in what darkness , what dense ignorance , was the mental battle fought !
I could not answer the ceaseless inward question— _ why _ I thus suffered ; now , at the distance of—I will not say how many years , I see it clearly .
I was a discord in Gateshead Hall : I was like nobody there ;
I had nothing in harmony with Mrs. Reed or her children , or her chosen vassalage .
If they did not love me , in fact , as little did I love them .
They were not bound to regard with affection a thing that could not sympathise with one amongst them ; a heterogeneous thing , opposed to them in temperament , in capacity , in propensities ; a useless thing , incapable of serving their interest , or adding to their pleasure ; a noxious thing , cherishing the germs of indignation at their treatment , of contempt of their judgment .
I know that had I been a sanguine , brilliant , careless , exacting , handsome , romping child—though equally dependent and friendless—Mrs . Reed would have endured my presence more complacently ; her children would have entertained for me more of the cordiality of fellow-feeling ; the servants would have been less prone to make me the scapegoat of the nursery .
Daylight began to forsake the red-room ; it was past four o 'clock , and the beclouded afternoon was tending to drear twilight .
I heard the rain still beating continuously on the staircase window , and the wind howling in the grove behind the hall ; I grew by degrees cold as a stone , and then my courage sank .
My habitual mood of humiliation , self-doubt , forlorn depression , fell damp on the embers of my decaying ire .
All said I was wicked , and perhaps I might be so ; what thought had I been but just conceiving of starving myself to death ?
That certainly was a crime : and was I fit to die ? Or was the vault under the chancel of Gateshead Church an inviting bourne ?
In such vault I had been told did Mr. Reed lie buried ; and led by this thought to recall his idea , I dwelt on it with gathering dread .
I could not remember him ; but I knew that he was my own uncle—my mother 's brother—that he had taken me when a parentless infant to his house ; and that in his last moments he had required a promise of Mrs. Reed that she would rear and maintain me as one of her own children .
Mrs. Reed probably considered she had kept this promise ; and so she had , I dare say , as well as her nature would permit her ; but how could she really like an interloper not of her race , and unconnected with her , after her husband 's death , by any tie ?
It must have been most irksome to find herself bound by a hard-wrung pledge to stand in the stead of a parent to a strange child she could not love , and to see an uncongenial alien permanently intruded on her own family group .
A singular notion dawned upon me .
I doubted not—never doubted—that if Mr. Reed had been alive he would have treated me kindly ; and now , as I sat looking at the white bed and overshadowed walls—occasionally also turning a fascinated eye towards the dimly gleaning mirror—I began to recall what I had heard of dead men , troubled in their graves by the violation of their last wishes , revisiting the earth to punish the perjured and avenge the oppressed ; and I thought Mr. Reed 's spirit , harassed by the wrongs of his sister 's child , might quit its abode—whether in the church vault or in the unknown world of the departed—and rise before me in this chamber .
I wiped my tears and hushed my sobs , fearful lest any sign of violent grief might waken a preternatural voice to comfort me , or elicit from the gloom some haloed face , bending over me with strange pity .
This idea , consolatory in theory , I felt would be terrible if realised : with all my might I endeavoured to stifle it—I endeavoured to be firm .
Shaking my hair from my eyes , I lifted my head and tried to look boldly round the dark room ; at this moment a light gleamed on the wall .
Was it , I asked myself , a ray from the moon penetrating some aperture in the blind ?
No ; moonlight was still , and this stirred ; while I gazed , it glided up to the ceiling and quivered over my head .
I can now conjecture readily that this streak of light was , in all likelihood , a gleam from a lantern carried by some one across the lawn : but then , prepared as my mind was for horror , shaken as my nerves were by agitation , I thought the swift darting beam was a herald of some coming vision from another world .
My heart beat thick , my head grew hot ; a sound filled my ears , which I deemed the rushing of wings ; something seemed near me ; I was oppressed , suffocated : endurance broke down ; I rushed to the door and shook the lock in desperate effort .
Steps came running along the outer passage ; the key turned , Bessie and Abbot entered .
" Miss Eyre , are you ill ?
" said Bessie .
" What a dreadful noise ! it went quite through me !
" exclaimed Abbot .
" Take me out !
Let me go into the nursery !
" was my cry .
" What for ?
Are you hurt ?
Have you seen something ?
" again demanded Bessie .
" Oh ! I saw a light , and I thought a ghost would come .
" I had now got hold of Bessie 's hand , and she did not snatch it from me .
" She has screamed out on purpose , " declared Abbot , in some disgust .
" And what a scream !
If she had been in great pain one would have excused it , but she only wanted to bring us all here : I know her naughty tricks .
" " What is all this ?
" demanded another voice peremptorily ; and Mrs. Reed came along the corridor , her cap flying wide , her gown rustling stormily .
" Abbot and Bessie , I believe I gave orders that Jane Eyre should be left in the red-room till I came to her myself .
" " Miss Jane screamed so loud , ma 'am , " pleaded Bessie .
" Let her go , " was the only answer .
" Loose Bessie 's hand , child : you cannot succeed in getting out by these means , be assured .
I abhor artifice , particularly in children ; it is my duty to show you that tricks will not answer : you will now stay here an hour longer , and it is only on condition of perfect submission and stillness that I shall liberate you then .
" " O aunt ! have pity !
Forgive me !
I cannot endure it—let me be punished some other way !
I shall be killed if— " " Silence !
This violence is all most repulsive : " and so , no doubt , she felt it .
I was a precocious actress in her eyes ; she sincerely looked on me as a compound of virulent passions , mean spirit , and dangerous duplicity .
Bessie and Abbot having retreated , Mrs. Reed , impatient of my now frantic anguish and wild sobs , abruptly thrust me back and locked me in , without farther parley .
I heard her sweeping away ; and soon after she was gone , I suppose I had a species of fit : unconsciousness closed the scene .
The next thing I remember is , waking up with a feeling as if I had had a frightful nightmare , and seeing before me a terrible red glare , crossed with thick black bars .
I heard voices , too , speaking with a hollow sound , and as if muffled by a rush of wind or water : agitation , uncertainty , and an all-predominating sense of terror confused my faculties .
Ere long , I became aware that some one was handling me ; lifting me up and supporting me in a sitting posture , and that more tenderly than I had ever been raised or upheld before .
I rested my head against a pillow or an arm , and felt easy .
In five minutes more the cloud of bewilderment dissolved : I knew quite well that I was in my own bed , and that the red glare was the nursery fire .
It was night : a candle burnt on the table ;
Bessie stood at the bed- foot with a basin in her hand , and a gentleman sat in a chair near my pillow , leaning over me .
I felt an inexpressible relief , a soothing conviction of protection and security , when I knew that there was a stranger in the room , an individual not belonging to Gateshead , and not related to Mrs. Reed .
Turning from Bessie ( though her presence was far less obnoxious to me than that of Abbot , for instance , would have been ) , I scrutinised the face of the gentleman : I knew him ; it was Mr. Lloyd , an apothecary , sometimes called in by Mrs. Reed when the servants were ailing : for herself and the children she employed a physician .
" Well , who am I ?
" he asked .
I pronounced his name , offering him at the same time my hand : he took it , smiling and saying , " We shall do very well by-and-by .
" Then he laid me down , and addressing Bessie , charged her to be very careful that I was not disturbed during the night .
Having given some further directions , and intimates that he should call again the next day , he departed ; to my grief : I felt so sheltered and befriended while he sat in the chair near my pillow ; and as he closed the door after him , all the room darkened and my heart again sank : inexpressible sadness weighed it down .
" Do you feel as if you should sleep , Miss ?
" asked Bessie , rather softly .
Scarcely dared I answer her ; for I feared the next sentence might be rough .
" I will try .
" " Would you like to drink , or could you eat anything ?
" " No , thank you , Bessie .
" " Then I think I shall go to bed , for it is past twelve o 'clock ; but you may call me if you want anything in the night .
" Wonderful civility this !
It emboldened me to ask a question .
" Bessie , what is the matter with me ?
Am I ill ?
" " You fell sick , I suppose , in the red-room with crying ; you 'll be better soon , no doubt .
" Bessie went into the housemaid 's apartment , which was near .
I heard her say— " Sarah , come and sleep with me in the nursery ;
I daren 't for my life be alone with that poor child to-night : she might die ; it 's such a strange thing she should have that fit : I wonder if she saw anything .
Missis was rather too hard .
" Sarah came back with her ; they both went to bed ; they were whispering together for half-an-hour before they fell asleep .
I caught scraps of their conversation , from which I was able only too distinctly to infer the main subject discussed .
" Something passed her , all dressed in white , and vanished " — " A great black dog behind him " — " Three loud raps on the chamber door " — " A light in the churchyard just over his grave , " & c .
& c .
At last both slept : the fire and the candle went out .
For me , the watches of that long night passed in ghastly wakefulness ; strained by dread : such dread as children only can feel .
No severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this incident of the red- room ; it only gave my nerves a shock of which I feel the reverberation to this day .
Yes , Mrs. Reed , to you I owe some fearful pangs of mental suffering , but I ought to forgive you , for you knew not what you did : while rending my heart-strings , you thought you were only uprooting my bad propensities .
Next day , by noon , I was up and dressed , and sat wrapped in a shawl by the nursery hearth .
I felt physically weak and broken down : but my worse ailment was an unutterable wretchedness of mind : a wretchedness which kept drawing from me silent tears ; no sooner had I wiped one salt drop from my cheek than another followed .
Yet , I thought , I ought to have been happy , for none of the Reeds were there , they were all gone out in the carriage with their mama . Abbot , too , was sewing in another room , and Bessie , as she moved hither and thither , putting away toys and arranging drawers , addressed to me every now and then a word of unwonted kindness .
This state of things should have been to me a paradise of peace , accustomed as I was to a life of ceaseless reprimand and thankless fagging ; but , in fact , my racked nerves were now in such a state that no calm could soothe , and no pleasure excite them agreeably .
Bessie had been down into the kitchen , and she brought up with her a tart on a certain brightly painted china plate , whose bird of paradise , nestling in a wreath of convolvuli and rosebuds , had been wont to stir in me a most enthusiastic sense of admiration ; and which plate I had often petitioned to be allowed to take in my hand in order to examine it more closely , but had always hitherto been deemed unworthy of such a privilege .
This precious vessel was now placed on my knee , and I was cordially invited to eat the circlet of delicate pastry upon it .
Vain favour ! coming , like most other favours long deferred and often wished for , too late !
I could not eat the tart ; and the plumage of the bird , the tints of the flowers , seemed strangely faded : I put both plate and tart away .
Bessie asked if I would have a book : the word _ book _ acted as a transient stimulus , and I begged her to fetch Gulliver 's Travels from the library .
This book I had again and again perused with delight .
I considered it a narrative of facts , and discovered in it a vein of interest deeper than what I found in fairy tales : for as to the elves , having sought them in vain among foxglove leaves and bells , under mushrooms and beneath the ground-ivy mantling old wall-nooks , I had at length made up my mind to the sad truth , that they were all gone out of England to some savage country where the woods were wilder and thicker , and the population more scant ; whereas , Lilliput and Brobdignag being , in my creed , solid parts of the earth 's surface , I doubted not that I might one day , by taking a long voyage , see with my own eyes the little fields , houses , and trees , the diminutive people , the tiny cows , sheep , and birds of the one realm ; and the corn-fields forest-high , the mighty mastiffs , the monster cats , the tower-like men and women , of the other .
Yet , when this cherished volume was now placed in my hand—when I turned over its leaves , and sought in its marvellous pictures the charm I had , till now , never failed to find—all was eerie and dreary ; the giants were gaunt goblins , the pigmies malevolent and fearful imps , Gulliver a most desolate wanderer in most dread and dangerous regions .
I closed the book , which I dared no longer peruse , and put it on the table , beside the untasted tart .
Bessie had now finished dusting and tidying the room , and having washed her hands , she opened a certain little drawer , full of splendid shreds of silk and satin , and began making a new bonnet for Georgiana 's doll .
Meantime she sang : her song was— " In the days when we went gipsying , A long time ago .
" I had often heard the song before , and always with lively delight ; for Bessie had a sweet voice , —at least , I thought so .
But now , though her voice was still sweet , I found in its melody an indescribable sadness .
Sometimes , preoccupied with her work , she sang the refrain very low , very lingeringly ; " A long time ago " came out like the saddest cadence of a funeral hymn .
She passed into another ballad , this time a really doleful one .
" My feet they are sore , and my limbs they are weary ;
Long is the way , and the mountains are wild ; Soon will the twilight close moonless and dreary Over the path of the poor orphan child .
Why did they send me so far and so lonely , Up where the moors spread and grey rocks are piled ?
Men are hard-hearted , and kind angels only Watch o 'er the steps of a poor orphan child .
Yet distant and soft the night breeze is blowing , Clouds there are none , and clear stars beam mild , God , in His mercy , protection is showing , Comfort and hope to the poor orphan child .
Ev 'n should I fall o 'er the broken bridge passing , Or stray in the marshes , by false lights beguiled , Still will my Father , with promise and blessing , Take to His bosom the poor orphan child .
There is a thought that for strength should avail me , Though both of shelter and kindred despoiled ;
Heaven is a home , and a rest will not fail me ; God is a friend to the poor orphan child .
" " Come , Miss Jane , don 't cry , " said Bessie as she finished .
She might as well have said to the fire , " don 't burn !
" but how could she divine the morbid suffering to which I was a prey ?
In the course of the morning Mr. Lloyd came again .
" What , already up !
" said he , as he entered the nursery .
" Well , nurse , how is she ?
" Bessie answered that I was doing very well .
" Then she ought to look more cheerful .
Come here , Miss Jane : your name is Jane , is it not ?
" " Yes , sir , Jane Eyre .
" " Well , you have been crying , Miss Jane Eyre ; can you tell me what about ?
Have you any pain ?
" " No , sir .
" " Oh ! I daresay she is crying because she could not go out with Missis in the carriage , " interposed Bessie .
" Surely not ! why , she is too old for such pettishness .
" I thought so too ; and my self-esteem being wounded by the false charge , I answered promptly , " I never cried for such a thing in my life : I hate going out in the carriage .
I cry because I am miserable .
" " Oh fie , Miss !
" said Bessie .
The good apothecary appeared a little puzzled .
I was standing before him ; he fixed his eyes on me very steadily : his eyes were small and grey ; not very bright , but I dare say I should think them shrewd now : he had a hard-featured yet good-natured looking face .
Having considered me at leisure , he said— " What made you ill yesterday ?
" " She had a fall , " said Bessie , again putting in her word .
" Fall ! why , that is like a baby again !
Can 't she manage to walk at her age ?
She must be eight or nine years old .
" " I was knocked down , " was the blunt explanation , jerked out of me by another pang of mortified pride ; " but that did not make me ill , " I added ; while Mr. Lloyd helped himself to a pinch of snuff .
As he was returning the box to his waistcoat pocket , a loud bell rang for the servants ' dinner ; he knew what it was . " That 's for you , nurse , " said he ; " you can go down ; I 'll give Miss Jane a lecture till you come back .
" Bessie would rather have stayed , but she was obliged to go , because punctuality at meals was rigidly enforced at Gateshead Hall .
" The fall did not make you ill ; what did , then ?
" pursued Mr. Lloyd when Bessie was gone .
" I was shut up in a room where there is a ghost till after dark .
" I saw Mr. Lloyd smile and frown at the same time .
" Ghost !
What , you are a baby after all !
You are afraid of ghosts ?
" " Of Mr. Reed 's ghost I am : he died in that room , and was laid out there .
Neither Bessie nor any one else will go into it at night , if they can help it ; and it was cruel to shut me up alone without a candle , —so cruel that I think I shall never forget it .
" " Nonsense !
And is it that makes you so miserable ?
Are you afraid now in daylight ?
" " No : but night will come again before long : and besides , —I am unhappy , —very unhappy , for other things .
" " What other things ?
Can you tell me some of them ?
" How much I wished to reply fully to this question !
How difficult it was to frame any answer !
Children can feel , but they cannot analyse their feelings ; and if the analysis is partially effected in thought , they know not how to express the result of the process in words .
Fearful , however , of losing this first and only opportunity of relieving my grief by imparting it , I , after a disturbed pause , contrived to frame a meagre , though , as far as it went , true response .
" For one thing , I have no father or mother , brothers or sisters .
" " You have a kind aunt and cousins .
" Again I paused ; then bunglingly enounced— " But John Reed knocked me down , and my aunt shut me up in the red-room .
" Mr. Lloyd a second time produced his snuff-box .
" Don 't you think Gateshead Hall a very beautiful house ?
" asked he .
" Are you not very thankful to have such a fine place to live at ?
" " It is not my house , sir ; and Abbot says I have less right to be here than a servant .
" " Pooh ! you can 't be silly enough to wish to leave such a splendid place ?
" " If I had anywhere else to go , I should be glad to leave it ; but I can never get away from Gateshead till I am a woman .
" " Perhaps you may—who knows ?
Have you any relations besides Mrs. Reed ?
" " I think not , sir .
" " None belonging to your father ?
" " I don 't know .
I asked Aunt Reed once , and she said possibly I might have some poor , low relations called Eyre , but she knew nothing about them .
" " If you had such , would you like to go to them ?
" I reflected .
Poverty looks grim to grown people ; still more so to children : they have not much idea of industrious , working , respectable poverty ; they think of the word only as connected with ragged clothes , scanty food , fireless grates , rude manners , and debasing vices : poverty for me was synonymous with degradation .
" No ;
I should not like to belong to poor people , " was my reply .
" Not even if they were kind to you ?
" I shook my head : I could not see how poor people had the means of being kind ; and then to learn to speak like them , to adopt their manners , to be uneducated , to grow up like one of the poor women I saw sometimes nursing their children or washing their clothes at the cottage doors of the village of Gateshead : no , I was not heroic enough to purchase liberty at the price of caste .
" But are your relatives so very poor ?
Are they working people ?
" " I cannot tell ;
Aunt Reed says if I have any , they must be a beggarly set : I should not like to go a begging .
" " Would you like to go to school ?
" Again I reflected : I scarcely knew what school was : Bessie sometimes spoke of it as a place where young ladies sat in the stocks , wore backboards , and were expected to be exceedingly genteel and precise : John Reed hated his school , and abused his master ; but John Reed 's tastes were no rule for mine , and if Bessie 's accounts of school-discipline ( gathered from the young ladies of a family where she had lived before coming to Gateshead ) were somewhat appalling , her details of certain accomplishments attained by these same young ladies were , I thought , equally attractive .

In the interview which followed between him and Mrs. Reed , I presume , from after-occurrences , that the apothecary ventured to recommend my being sent to school ; and the recommendation was no doubt readily enough adopted ; for as Abbot said , in discussing the subject with Bessie when both sat sewing in the nursery one night , after I was in bed , and , as they thought , asleep , " Missis was , she dared say , glad enough to get rid of such a tiresome , ill-conditioned child , who always looked as if she were watching everybody , and scheming plots underhand .

" " Oh fie , Miss !
She boasted of beautiful paintings of landscapes and flowers by them executed ; of songs they could sing and pieces they could play , of purses they could net , of French books they could translate ; till my spirit was moved to emulation as I listened .
" Bessie would rather have stayed , but she was obliged to go , because punctuality at meals was rigidly enforced at Gateshead Hall .
" " Yes , I doat on Miss Georgiana !
" you can go down ;
" you can go down ;

It tarried , however : days and weeks passed : I had regained my normal state of health , but no new allusion was made to the subject over which I brooded .
It tarried , however : days and weeks passed : I had regained my normal state of health , but no new allusion was made to the subject over which I brooded .
Mrs. Reed surveyed me at times with a severe eye , but seldom addressed me : since my illness , she had drawn a more marked line of separation than ever between me and her own children ; appointing me a small closet to sleep in by myself , condemning me to take my meals alone , and pass all my time in the nursery , while my cousins were constantly in the drawing-room .
Not a hint , however , did she drop about sending me to school : still I felt an instinctive certainty that she would not long endure me under the same roof with her ; for her glance , now more than ever , when turned on me , expressed an insuperable and rooted aversion .
Eliza and Georgiana , evidently acting according to orders , spoke to me as little as possible : John thrust his tongue in his cheek whenever he saw me , and once attempted chastisement ; but as I instantly turned against him , roused by the same sentiment of deep ire and desperate revolt which had stirred my corruption before , he thought it better to desist , and ran from me tittering execrations , and vowing I had burst his nose .
I had indeed levelled at that prominent feature as hard a blow as my knuckles could inflict ; and when I saw that either that or my look daunted him , I had the greatest inclination to follow up my advantage to purpose ; but he was already with his mama .
I heard him in a blubbering tone commence the tale of how " that nasty Jane Eyre " had flown at him like a mad cat : he was stopped rather harshly— " Don 't talk to me about her , John : I told you not to go near her ; she is not worthy of notice ;
I do not choose that either you or your sisters should associate with her .
" Here , leaning over the banister , I cried out suddenly , and without at all deliberating on my words— " They are not fit to associate with me .
" Mrs. Reed was rather a stout woman ; but , on hearing this strange and audacious declaration , she ran nimbly up the stair , swept me like a whirlwind into the nursery , and crushing me down on the edge of my crib , dared me in an emphatic voice to rise from that place , or utter one syllable during the remainder of the day .
" What would Uncle Reed say to you , if he were alive ?
" was my scarcely voluntary demand .
I say scarcely voluntary , for it seemed as if my tongue pronounced words without my will consenting to their utterance : something spoke out of me over which I had no control .
" What ?
" said Mrs. Reed under her breath : her usually cold composed grey eye became troubled with a look like fear ; she took her hand from my arm , and gazed at me as if she really did not know whether I were child or fiend .
I was now in for it .
" My Uncle Reed is in heaven , and can see all you do and think ; and so can papa and mama : they know how you shut me up all day long , and how you wish me dead .
" Mrs. Reed soon rallied her spirits : she shook me most soundly , she boxed both my ears , and then left me without a word .
Bessie supplied the hiatus by a homily of an hour 's length , in which she proved beyond a doubt that I was the most wicked and abandoned child ever reared under a roof .
I half believed her ; for I felt indeed only bad feelings surging in my breast .
November , December , and half of January passed away .
Christmas and the New Year had been celebrated at Gateshead with the usual festive cheer ; presents had been interchanged , dinners and evening parties given .
From every enjoyment I was , of course , excluded : my share of the gaiety consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of Eliza and Georgiana , and seeing them descend to the drawing-room , dressed out in thin muslin frocks and scarlet sashes , with hair elaborately ringletted ; and afterwards , in listening to the sound of the piano or the harp played below , to the passing to and fro of the butler and footman , to the jingling of glass and china as refreshments were handed , to the broken hum of conversation as the drawing-room door opened and closed .
When tired of this occupation , I would retire from the stairhead to the solitary and silent nursery : there , though somewhat sad , I was not miserable .
To speak truth , I had not the least wish to go into company , for in company I was very rarely noticed ; and if Bessie had but been kind and companionable , I should have deemed it a treat to spend the evenings quietly with her , instead of passing them under the formidable eye of Mrs. Reed , in a room full of ladies and gentlemen .
But Bessie , as soon as she had dressed her young ladies , used to take herself off to the lively regions of the kitchen and housekeeper 's room , generally bearing the candle along with her .
I then sat with my doll on my knee till the fire got low , glancing round occasionally to make sure that nothing worse than myself haunted the shadowy room ; and when the embers sank to a dull red , I undressed hastily , tugging at knots and strings as I best might , and sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib .
To this crib I always took my doll ; human beings must love something , and , in the dearth of worthier objects of affection , I contrived to find a pleasure in loving and cherishing a faded graven image , shabby as a miniature scarecrow .
It puzzles me now to remember with what absurd sincerity I doated on this little toy , half fancying it alive and capable of sensation .
I could not sleep unless it was folded in my night-gown ; and when it lay there safe and warm , I was comparatively happy , believing it to be happy likewise .
Long did the hours seem while I waited the departure of the company , and listened for the sound of Bessie 's step on the stairs : sometimes she would come up in the interval to seek her thimble or her scissors , or perhaps to bring me something by way of supper—a bun or a cheese-cake—then she would sit on the bed while I ate it , and when I had finished , she would tuck the clothes round me , and twice she kissed me , and said , " Good night , Miss Jane .
" When thus gentle , Bessie seemed to me the best , prettiest , kindest being in the world ; and I wished most intensely that she would always be so pleasant and amiable , and never push me about , or scold , or task me unreasonably , as she was too often wont to do .
Bessie Lee must , I think , have been a girl of good natural capacity , for she was smart in all she did , and had a remarkable knack of narrative ; so , at least , I judge from the impression made on me by her nursery tales .
She was pretty too , if my recollections of her face and person are correct .
I remember her as a slim young woman , with black hair , dark eyes , very nice features , and good , clear complexion ; but she had a capricious and hasty temper , and indifferent ideas of principle or justice : still , such as she was , I preferred her to any one else at Gateshead Hall .
It was the fifteenth of January , about nine o 'clock in the morning : Bessie was gone down to breakfast ; my cousins had not yet been summoned to their mama ;
Eliza was putting on her bonnet and warm garden-coat to go and feed her poultry , an occupation of which she was fond : and not less so of selling the eggs to the housekeeper and hoarding up the money she thus obtained .
She had a turn for traffic , and a marked propensity for saving ; shown not only in the vending of eggs and chickens , but also in driving hard bargains with the gardener about flower-roots , seeds , and slips of plants ; that functionary having orders from Mrs. Reed to buy of his young lady all the products of her parterre she wished to sell : and Eliza would have sold the hair off her head if she could have made a handsome profit thereby .
As to her money , she first secreted it in odd corners , wrapped in a rag or an old curl-paper ; but some of these hoards having been discovered by the housemaid , Eliza , fearful of one day losing her valued treasure , consented to intrust it to her mother , at a usurious rate of interest—fifty or sixty per cent . ; which interest she exacted every quarter , keeping her accounts in a little book with anxious accuracy .
Georgiana sat on a high stool , dressing her hair at the glass , and interweaving her curls with artificial flowers and faded feathers , of which she had found a store in a drawer in the attic .
I was making my bed , having received strict orders from Bessie to get it arranged before she returned ( for Bessie now frequently employed me as a sort of under- nurserymaid , to tidy the room , dust the chairs , & c . ) .
Having spread the quilt and folded my night-dress , I went to the window-seat to put in order some picture-books and doll 's house furniture scattered there ; an abrupt command from Georgiana to let her playthings alone ( for the tiny chairs and mirrors , the fairy plates and cups , were her property ) stopped my proceedings ; and then , for lack of other occupation , I fell to breathing on the frost-flowers with which the window was fretted , and thus clearing a space in the glass through which I might look out on the grounds , where all was still and petrified under the influence of a hard frost .
From this window were visible the porter 's lodge and the carriage-road , and just as I had dissolved so much of the silver-white foliage veiling the panes as left room to look out , I saw the gates thrown open and a carriage roll through .
I watched it ascending the drive with indifference ; carriages often came to Gateshead , but none ever brought visitors in whom I was interested ; it stopped in front of the house , the door-bell rang loudly , the new-comer was admitted .
All this being nothing to me , my vacant attention soon found livelier attraction in the spectacle of a little hungry robin , which came and chirruped on the twigs of the leafless cherry-tree nailed against the wall near the casement .
The remains of my breakfast of bread and milk stood on the table , and having crumbled a morsel of roll , I was tugging at the sash to put out the crumbs on the window-sill , when Bessie came running upstairs into the nursery .
" Miss Jane , take off your pinafore ; what are you doing there ?
Have you washed your hands and face this morning ?
" I gave another tug before I answered , for I wanted the bird to be secure of its bread : the sash yielded ; I scattered the crumbs , some on the stone sill , some on the cherry-tree bough , then , closing the window , I replied— " No , Bessie ;
I have only just finished dusting .
" " Troublesome , careless child ! and what are you doing now ?
You look quite red , as if you had been about some mischief : what were you opening the window for ?
" I was spared the trouble of answering , for Bessie seemed in too great a hurry to listen to explanations ; she hauled me to the washstand , inflicted a merciless , but happily brief scrub on my face and hands with soap , water , and a coarse towel ; disciplined my head with a bristly brush , denuded me of my pinafore , and then hurrying me to the top of the stairs , bid me go down directly , as I was wanted in the breakfast-room .
I would have asked who wanted me : I would have demanded if Mrs. Reed was there ; but Bessie was already gone , and had closed the nursery-door upon me .
I slowly descended .
For nearly three months , I had never been called to Mrs. Reed 's presence ; restricted so long to the nursery , the breakfast , dining , and drawing-rooms were become for me awful regions , on which it dismayed me to intrude .
I now stood in the empty hall ; before me was the breakfast-room door , and I stopped , intimidated and trembling .
What a miserable little poltroon had fear , engendered of unjust punishment , made of me in those days !
I feared to return to the nursery , and feared to go forward to the parlour ; ten minutes I stood in agitated hesitation ; the vehement ringing of the breakfast-room bell decided me ;
I _ must _ enter .
" Who could want me ?
" I asked inwardly , as with both hands I turned the stiff door-handle , which , for a second or two , resisted my efforts .
" What should I see besides Aunt Reed in the apartment ? —a man or a woman ?
" The handle turned , the door unclosed , and passing through and curtseying low , I looked up at—a black pillar ! —such , at least , appeared to me , at first sight , the straight , narrow , sable-clad shape standing erect on the rug : the grim face at the top was like a carved mask , placed above the shaft by way of capital .
Mrs. Reed occupied her usual seat by the fireside ; she made a signal to me to approach ;
I did so , and she introduced me to the stony stranger with the words : " This is the little girl respecting whom I applied to you .
" _ He _ , for it was a man , turned his head slowly towards where I stood , and having examined me with the two inquisitive-looking grey eyes which twinkled under a pair of bushy brows , said solemnly , and in a bass voice , " Her size is small : what is her age ?
" " Ten years .
" " So much ?
" was the doubtful answer ; and he prolonged his scrutiny for some minutes .
Presently he addressed me— " Your name , little girl ?
" " Jane Eyre , sir .
" In uttering these words I looked up : he seemed to me a tall gentleman ; but then I was very little ; his features were large , and they and all the lines of his frame were equally harsh and prim .
" Well , Jane Eyre , and are you a good child ?
" Impossible to reply to this in the affirmative : my little world held a contrary opinion : I was silent .
Mrs. Reed answered for me by an expressive shake of the head , adding soon , " Perhaps the less said on that subject the better , Mr. Brocklehurst .
" " Sorry indeed to hear it ! she and I must have some talk ; " and bending from the perpendicular , he installed his person in the arm-chair opposite Mrs. Reed 's .
" Come here , " he said .
I stepped across the rug ; he placed me square and straight before him .
What a face he had , now that it was almost on a level with mine ! what a great nose ! and what a mouth ! and what large prominent teeth !
" No sight so sad as that of a naughty child , " he began , " especially a naughty little girl .
Do you know where the wicked go after death ?
" " They go to hell , " was my ready and orthodox answer .
" And what is hell ?
Can you tell me that ?
" " A pit full of fire .
" " And should you like to fall into that pit , and to be burning there for ever ?
" " No , sir .
" " What must you do to avoid it ?
" I deliberated a moment ; my answer , when it did come , was objectionable : " I must keep in good health , and not die .
" " How can you keep in good health ?
Children younger than you die daily .
I buried a little child of five years old only a day or two since , —a good little child , whose soul is now in heaven .
It is to be feared the same could not be said of you were you to be called hence .
" Not being in a condition to remove his doubt , I only cast my eyes down on the two large feet planted on the rug , and sighed , wishing myself far enough away .
" I hope that sigh is from the heart , and that you repent of ever having been the occasion of discomfort to your excellent benefactress .
" " Benefactress ! benefactress !
" said I inwardly : " they all call Mrs. Reed my benefactress ; if so , a benefactress is a disagreeable thing .
" " Do you say your prayers night and morning ?
" continued my interrogator .
" Yes , sir .
" " Do you read your Bible ?
" " Sometimes .
" " With pleasure ?
Are you fond of it ?
" " I like Revelations , and the book of Daniel , and Genesis and Samuel , and a little bit of Exodus , and some parts of Kings and Chronicles , and Job and Jonah .
" " And the Psalms ?
I hope you like them ?
" " No , sir .
" " No ? oh , shocking !
I have a little boy , younger than you , who knows six Psalms by heart : and when you ask him which he would rather have , a gingerbread-nut to eat or a verse of a Psalm to learn , he says : ' Oh ! the verse of a Psalm ! angels sing Psalms ;
' says he , ' I wish to be a little angel here below ; ' he then gets two nuts in recompense for his infant piety .
" " Psalms are not interesting , " I remarked .
" That proves you have a wicked heart ; and you must pray to God to change it : to give you a new and clean one : to take away your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh .
" I was about to propound a question , touching the manner in which that operation of changing my heart was to be performed , when Mrs. Reed interposed , telling me to sit down ; she then proceeded to carry on the conversation herself .
" Mr. Brocklehurst , I believe I intimated in the letter which I wrote to you three weeks ago , that this little girl has not quite the character and disposition I could wish : should you admit her into Lowood school , I should be glad if the superintendent and teachers were requested to keep a strict eye on her , and , above all , to guard against her worst fault , a tendency to deceit .
I mention this in your hearing , Jane , that you may not attempt to impose on Mr. Brocklehurst .
" Well might I dread , well might I dislike Mrs. Reed ; for it was her nature to wound me cruelly ; never was I happy in her presence ; however carefully I obeyed , however strenuously I strove to please her , my efforts were still repulsed and repaid by such sentences as the above .
Now , uttered before a stranger , the accusation cut me to the heart ;
I dimly perceived that she was already obliterating hope from the new phase of existence which she destined me to enter ; I felt , though I could not have expressed the feeling , that she was sowing aversion and unkindness along my future path ;
I saw myself transformed under Mr. Brocklehurst 's eye into an artful , noxious child , and what could I do to remedy the injury ?
" Nothing , indeed , " thought I , as I struggled to repress a sob , and hastily wiped away some tears , the impotent evidences of my anguish .
" Deceit is , indeed , a sad fault in a child , " said Mr. Brocklehurst ; " it is akin to falsehood , and all liars will have their portion in the lake burning with fire and brimstone ; she shall , however , be watched , Mrs. Reed . I will speak to Miss Temple and the teachers .
" " I should wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting her prospects , " continued my benefactress ;
" to be made useful , to be kept humble : as for the vacations , she will , with your permission , spend them always at Lowood .
" " Your decisions are perfectly judicious , madam , " returned Mr. Brocklehurst .
" Humility is a Christian grace , and one peculiarly appropriate to the pupils of Lowood ;
I , therefore , direct that especial care shall be bestowed on its cultivation amongst them .
I have studied how best to mortify in them the worldly sentiment of pride ; and , only the other day , I had a pleasing proof of my success .
My second daughter , Augusta , went with her mama to visit the school , and on her return she exclaimed : ' Oh , dear papa , how quiet and plain all the girls at Lowood look , with their hair combed behind their ears , and their long pinafores , and those little holland pockets outside their frocks—they are almost like poor people 's children ! and , ' said she , ' they looked at my dress and mama 's , as if they had never seen a silk gown before .
' " " This is the state of things I quite approve , " returned Mrs. Reed ;
" had I sought all England over , I could scarcely have found a system more exactly fitting a child like Jane Eyre .
Consistency , my dear Mr. Brocklehurst ; I advocate consistency in all things .
" " Consistency , madam , is the first of Christian duties ; and it has been observed in every arrangement connected with the establishment of Lowood : plain fare , simple attire , unsophisticated accommodations , hardy and active habits ; such is the order of the day in the house and its inhabitants .
" " Quite right , sir .
I may then depend upon this child being received as a pupil at Lowood , and there being trained in conformity to her position and prospects ?
" " Madam , you may : she shall be placed in that nursery of chosen plants , and I trust she will show herself grateful for the inestimable privilege of her election .
" " I will send her , then , as soon as possible , Mr. Brocklehurst ; for , I assure you , I feel anxious to be relieved of a responsibility that was becoming too irksome .
" " No doubt , no doubt , madam ; and now I wish you good morning .
I shall return to Brocklehurst Hall in the course of a week or two : my good friend , the Archdeacon , will not permit me to leave him sooner .
I shall send Miss Temple notice that she is to expect a new girl , so that there will be no difficulty about receiving her .
Good-bye .
" " Good-bye , Mr. Brocklehurst ; remember me to Mrs. and Miss Brocklehurst , and to Augusta and Theodore , and Master Broughton Brocklehurst .
" " I will , madam .
Little girl , here is a book entitled the ' Child 's Guide , ' read it with prayer , especially that part containing ' An account of the awfully sudden death of Martha G— , a naughty child addicted to falsehood and deceit .
' " With these words Mr. Brocklehurst put into my hand a thin pamphlet sewn in a cover , and having rung for his carriage , he departed .
Mrs. Reed and I were left alone : some minutes passed in silence ; she was sewing , I was watching her .
Mrs. Reed might be at that time some six or seven and thirty ; she was a woman of robust frame , square-shouldered and strong-limbed , not tall , and , though stout , not obese : she had a somewhat large face , the under jaw being much developed and very solid ; her brow was low , her chin large and prominent , mouth and nose sufficiently regular ; under her light eyebrows glimmered an eye devoid of ruth ; her skin was dark and opaque , her hair nearly flaxen ; her constitution was sound as a bell—illness never came near her ; she was an exact , clever manager ; her household and tenantry were thoroughly under her control ; her children only at times defied her authority and laughed it to scorn ; she dressed well , and had a presence and port calculated to set off handsome attire .
Sitting on a low stool , a few yards from her arm-chair , I examined her figure ;
In my hand I held the tract containing the sudden death of the Liar , to which narrative my attention had been pointed as to an appropriate warning .
Mrs. Reed answered for me by an expressive shake of the head , adding soon , " Perhaps the less said on that subject the better , Mr. Brocklehurst .
I felt , though I could not have expressed the feeling , that she was sowing aversion and unkindness along my future path ;
" I was about to propound a question , touching the manner in which that operation of changing my heart was to be performed , when Mrs. Reed interposed , telling me to sit down ; she then proceeded to carry on the conversation herself .
" " No ? oh , shocking !
My second daughter , Augusta , went with her mama to visit the school , and on her return she exclaimed : ' Oh , dear papa , how quiet and plain all the girls at Lowood look , with their hair combed behind their ears , and their long pinafores , and those little holland pockets outside their frocks—they are almost like poor people 's children ! and , ' said she , ' they looked at my dress and mama 's , as if they had never seen a silk gown before .
I felt , though I could not have expressed the feeling , that she was sowing aversion and unkindness along my future path ;
I stepped across the rug ; he placed me square and straight before him .
" " Sorry indeed to hear it ! she and I must have some talk ;
" " What must you do to avoid it ?
" Well might I dread , well might I dislike Mrs. Reed ; for it was her nature to wound me cruelly ; never was I happy in her presence ; however carefully I obeyed , however strenuously I strove to please her , my efforts were still repulsed and repaid by such sentences as the above .
Mrs. Reed answered for me by an expressive shake of the head , adding soon , " Perhaps the less said on that subject the better , Mr. Brocklehurst .
Presently he addressed me— " Your name , little girl ?
I had felt every word as acutely as I had heard it plainly , and a passion of resentment fomented now within me .
" Nothing , indeed , " thought I , as I struggled to repress a sob , and hastily wiped away some tears , the impotent evidences of my anguish .

" Well might I dread , well might I dislike Mrs. Reed ; for it was her nature to wound me cruelly ; never was I happy in her presence ; however carefully I obeyed , however strenuously I strove to please her , my efforts were still repulsed and repaid by such sentences as the above .
Can you tell me that ?
" And what is hell ?
I felt , though I could not have expressed the feeling , that she was sowing aversion and unkindness along my future path ;
I had felt every word as acutely as I had heard it plainly , and a passion of resentment fomented now within me .

" " Benefactress ! benefactress !
I saw myself transformed under Mr. Brocklehurst 's eye into an artful , noxious child , and what could I do to remedy the injury ?
I had felt every word as acutely as I had heard it plainly , and a passion of resentment fomented now within me .
" Well , Jane Eyre , and are you a good child ?
" " No ? oh , shocking !
" " No ? oh , shocking !
" Ere I had finished this reply , my soul began to expand , to exult , with the strangest sense of freedom , of triumph , I ever felt .
I came back again ;
" Nothing , indeed , " thought I , as I struggled to repress a sob , and hastily wiped away some tears , the impotent evidences of my anguish .
" Well might I dread , well might I dislike Mrs. Reed ; for it was her nature to wound me cruelly ; never was I happy in her presence ; however carefully I obeyed , however strenuously I strove to please her , my efforts were still repulsed and repaid by such sentences as the above .
" Well , Jane Eyre , and are you a good child ?
" What more have you to say ?
How dare I ?
Would you like to drink some water ?
" " No , sir .
" What more have you to say ?
You think I have no feelings , and that I can do without one bit of love or kindness ; but I cannot live so : and you have no pity .
" " Not you .
" Deceit is , indeed , a sad fault in a child , " said Mr. Brocklehurst ;
I may then depend upon this child being received as a pupil at Lowood , and there being trained in conformity to her position and prospects ?
Can you tell me that ?
" Jane , you are under a mistake : what is the matter with you ?
" Deceit is , indeed , a sad fault in a child , " said Mr. Brocklehurst ;
" " Deceit is not my fault !
" All at once I heard a clear voice call , " Miss Jane ! where are you ?
" " How dare you affirm that , Jane Eyre ?
" Well , Jane Eyre , and are you a good child ?
Would you like to drink some water ?
" " I am not your dear ;
" " Deceit is not my fault !
I cannot lie down : send me to school soon , Mrs. Reed , for I hate to live here .
" " I will indeed send her to school soon , " murmured Mrs. Reed _ sotto voce _ ; and gathering up her work , she abruptly quitted the apartment .
I was left there alone—winner of the field .
It was the hardest battle I had fought , and the first victory I had gained : I stood awhile on the rug , where Mr. Brocklehurst had stood , and I enjoyed my conqueror 's solitude .
First , I smiled to myself and felt elate ; but this fierce pleasure subsided in me as fast as did the accelerated throb of my pulses .
A child cannot quarrel with its elders , as I had done ; cannot give its furious feelings uncontrolled play , as I had given mine , without experiencing afterwards the pang of remorse and the chill of reaction .
A ridge of lighted heath , alive , glancing , devouring , would have been a meet emblem of my mind when I accused and menaced Mrs. Reed : the same ridge , black and blasted after the flames are dead , would have represented as meetly my subsequent condition , when half-an-hour 's silence and reflection had shown me the madness of my conduct , and the dreariness of my hated and hating position .
Something of vengeance I had tasted for the first time ; as aromatic wine it seemed , on swallowing , warm and racy : its after-flavour , metallic and corroding , gave me a sensation as if I had been poisoned .
Willingly would I now have gone and asked Mrs. Reed 's pardon ; but I knew , partly from experience and partly from instinct , that was the way to make her repulse me with double scorn , thereby re-exciting every turbulent impulse of my nature .
I would fain exercise some better faculty than that of fierce speaking ; fain find nourishment for some less fiendish feeling than that of sombre indignation .
I took a book—some Arabian tales ; I sat down and endeavoured to read .
I could make no sense of the subject ; my own thoughts swam always between me and the page I had usually found fascinating .
I opened the glass-door in the breakfast-room : the shrubbery was quite still : the black frost reigned , unbroken by sun or breeze , through the grounds .
I covered my head and arms with the skirt of my frock , and went out to walk in a part of the plantation which was quite sequestrated ; but I found no pleasure in the silent trees , the falling fir-cones , the congealed relics of autumn , russet leaves , swept by past winds in heaps , and now stiffened together .
I leaned against a gate , and looked into an empty field where no sheep were feeding , where the short grass was nipped and blanched .
It was a very grey day ; a most opaque sky , " onding on snaw , " canopied all ; thence flakes felt it intervals , which settled on the hard path and on the hoary lea without melting .
I stood , a wretched child enough , whispering to myself over and over again , " What shall I do ? —what shall I do ?
" All at once I heard a clear voice call , " Miss Jane ! where are you ?
Come to lunch !
" It was Bessie , I knew well enough ; but I did not stir ; her light step came tripping down the path .
" You naughty little thing !
" she said .
" Why don 't you come when you are called ?
" Bessie 's presence , compared with the thoughts over which I had been brooding , seemed cheerful ; even though , as usual , she was somewhat cross .
The fact is , after my conflict with and victory over Mrs. Reed , I was not disposed to care much for the nursemaid 's transitory anger ; and I _ was _ disposed to bask in her youthful lightness of heart .
I just put my two arms round her and said , " Come , Bessie ! don 't scold .
" The action was more frank and fearless than any I was habituated to indulge in : somehow it pleased her .
" You are a strange child , Miss Jane , " she said , as she looked down at me ; " a little roving , solitary thing : and you are going to school , I suppose ?
" I nodded .
" And won 't you be sorry to leave poor Bessie ?
" " What does Bessie care for me ?
She is always scolding me .
" " Because you 're such a queer , frightened , shy little thing .
You should be bolder .
" " What ! to get more knocks ?
" " Nonsense !
But you are rather put upon , that 's certain .
My mother said , when she came to see me last week , that she would not like a little one of her own to be in your place.—Now , come in , and I 've some good news for you .
" " I don 't think you have , Bessie .
" " Child ! what do you mean ?
What sorrowful eyes you fix on me !
Well , but Missis and the young ladies and Master John are going out to tea this afternoon , and you shall have tea with me .
I 'll ask cook to bake you a little cake , and then you shall help me to look over your drawers ; for I am soon to pack your trunk .
Missis intends you to leave Gateshead in a day or two , and you shall choose what toys you like to take with you .
" " Bessie , you must promise not to scold me any more till I go .
" " Well , I will ; but mind you are a very good girl , and don 't be afraid of me .
Don 't start when I chance to speak rather sharply ; it 's so provoking .
" " I don 't think I shall ever be afraid of you again , Bessie , because I have got used to you , and I shall soon have another set of people to dread .
" " If you dread them they 'll dislike you .
" " As you do , Bessie ?
" " I don 't dislike you , Miss ; I believe I am fonder of you than of all the others .
" " You don 't show it .
" " You little sharp thing ! you 've got quite a new way of talking .
What makes you so venturesome and hardy ?
" " Why , I shall soon be away from you , and besides " —I was going to say something about what had passed between me and Mrs. Reed , but on second thoughts I considered it better to remain silent on that head .
" And so you 're glad to leave me ?
" " Not at all , Bessie ; indeed , just now I 'm rather sorry .
" " Just now ! and rather !
How coolly my little lady says it !
I dare say now if I were to ask you for a kiss you wouldn 't give it me : you 'd say you 'd _ rather _ not .
" " I 'll kiss you and welcome : bend your head down .
" Bessie stooped ; we mutually embraced , and I followed her into the house quite comforted .
That afternoon lapsed in peace and harmony ; and in the evening Bessie told me some of her most enchanting stories , and sang me some of her sweetest songs .
Even for me life had its gleams of sunshine .
Five o 'clock had hardly struck on the morning of the 19th of January , when Bessie brought a candle into my closet and found me already up and nearly dressed .
I had risen half-an-hour before her entrance , and had washed my face , and put on my clothes by the light of a half-moon just setting , whose rays streamed through the narrow window near my crib .
I was to leave Gateshead that day by a coach which passed the lodge gates at six a.m.
Bessie was the only person yet risen ; she had lit a fire in the nursery , where she now proceeded to make my breakfast .
Few children can eat when excited with the thoughts of a journey ; nor could I. Bessie , having pressed me in vain to take a few spoonfuls of the boiled milk and bread she had prepared for me , wrapped up some biscuits in a paper and put them into my bag ; then she helped me on with my pelisse and bonnet , and wrapping herself in a shawl , she and I left the nursery .
As we passed Mrs. Reed 's bedroom , she said , " Will you go in and bid Missis good- bye ?
" " No , Bessie : she came to my crib last night when you were gone down to supper , and said I need not disturb her in the morning , or my cousins either ; and she told me to remember that she had always been my best friend , and to speak of her and be grateful to her accordingly .
" " What did you say , Miss ?
" " Nothing : I covered my face with the bedclothes , and turned from her to the wall .
" " That was wrong , Miss Jane .
" " It was quite right , Bessie .
Your Missis has not been my friend : she has been my foe .
" " O Miss Jane ! don 't say so !
" " Good-bye to Gateshead !
" cried I , as we passed through the hall and went out at the front door .
The moon was set , and it was very dark ;
Bessie carried a lantern , whose light glanced on wet steps and gravel road sodden by a recent thaw .
Raw and chill was the winter morning : my teeth chattered as I hastened down the drive .
There was a light in the porter 's lodge : when we reached it , we found the porter 's wife just kindling her fire : my trunk , which had been carried down the evening before , stood corded at the door .
It wanted but a few minutes of six , and shortly after that hour had struck , the distant roll of wheels announced the coming coach ;
I went to the door and watched its lamps approach rapidly through the gloom .
" Is she going by herself ?
" asked the porter 's wife .
" Yes .
" " And how far is it ?
" " Fifty miles .
" " What a long way !
I wonder Mrs. Reed is not afraid to trust her so far alone .
" The coach drew up ; there it was at the gates with its four horses and its top laden with passengers : the guard and coachman loudly urged haste ; my trunk was hoisted up ;
I was taken from Bessie 's neck , to which I clung with kisses .
" Be sure and take good care of her , " cried she to the guard , as he lifted me into the inside .
" Ay , ay !
" was the answer : the door was slapped to , a voice exclaimed " All right , " and on we drove .
Thus was I severed from Bessie and Gateshead ; thus whirled away to unknown , and , as I then deemed , remote and mysterious regions .
I remember but little of the journey ;
I only know that the day seemed to me of a preternatural length , and that we appeared to travel over hundreds of miles of road .
We passed through several towns , and in one , a very large one , the coach stopped ; the horses were taken out , and the passengers alighted to dine .
I was carried into an inn , where the guard wanted me to have some dinner ; but , as I had no appetite , he left me in an immense room with a fireplace at each end , a chandelier pendent from the ceiling , and a little red gallery high up against the wall filled with musical instruments .
Here I walked about for a long time , feeling very strange , and mortally apprehensive of some one coming in and kidnapping me ; for I believed in kidnappers , their exploits having frequently figured in Bessie 's fireside chronicles .
At last the guard returned ; once more I was stowed away in the coach , my protector mounted his own seat , sounded his hollow horn , and away we rattled over the " stony street " of L- .
The afternoon came on wet and somewhat misty : as it waned into dusk , I began to feel that we were getting very far indeed from Gateshead : we ceased to pass through towns ; the country changed ; great grey hills heaved up round the horizon : as twilight deepened , we descended a valley , dark with wood , and long after night had overclouded the prospect , I heard a wild wind rushing amongst trees .
Lulled by the sound , I at last dropped asleep ;
I had not long slumbered when the sudden cessation of motion awoke me ; the coach-door was open , and a person like a servant was standing at it : I saw her face and dress by the light of the lamps .
" Is there a little girl called Jane Eyre here ?
" she asked .
I answered " Yes , " and was then lifted out ; my trunk was handed down , and the coach instantly drove away .
I was stiff with long sitting , and bewildered with the noise and motion of the coach : Gathering my faculties , I looked about me .
Rain , wind , and darkness filled the air ; nevertheless , I dimly discerned a wall before me and a door open in it ; through this door I passed with my new guide : she shut and locked it behind her .
There was now visible a house or houses—for the building spread far—with many windows , and lights burning in some ; we went up a broad pebbly path , splashing wet , and were admitted at a door ; then the servant led me through a passage into a room with a fire , where she left me alone .
I stood and warmed my numbed fingers over the blaze , then I looked round ; there was no candle , but the uncertain light from the hearth showed , by intervals , papered walls , carpet , curtains , shining mahogany furniture : it was a parlour , not so spacious or splendid as the drawing-room at Gateshead , but comfortable enough .
I was puzzling to make out the subject of a picture on the wall , when the door opened , and an individual carrying a light entered ; another followed close behind .
The first was a tall lady with dark hair , dark eyes , and a pale and large forehead ; her figure was partly enveloped in a shawl , her countenance was grave , her bearing erect .
" The child is very young to be sent alone , " said she , putting her candle down on the table .
" " Not at all , Bessie ; indeed , just now I 'm rather sorry .
" And so you 're glad to leave me ?
" she asked .
" " I don 't dislike you , Miss ;
" " And how far is it ?
" " Bessie , you must promise not to scold me any more till I go .
" And so you 're glad to leave me ?
" she asked .
" she asked .
" " Well , I will ; but mind you are a very good girl , and don 't be afraid of me .
" " Why , I shall soon be away from you , and besides " —I was going to say something about what had passed between me and Mrs. Reed , but on second thoughts I considered it better to remain silent on that head .

To-night I was to be Miss Miller 's bed-fellow ; she helped me to undress : when laid down I glanced at the long rows of beds , each of which was quickly filled with two occupants ; in ten minutes the single light was extinguished , and amidst silence and complete darkness I fell asleep .

Seen by the dim light of the dips , their number to me appeared countless , though not in reality exceeding eighty ; they were uniformly dressed in brown stuff frocks of quaint fashion , and long holland pinafores .

I had risen half-an-hour before her entrance , and had washed my face , and put on my clothes by the light of a half-moon just setting , whose rays streamed through the narrow window near my crib .
Miss Miller signed to me to sit on a bench near the door , then walking up to the top of the long room she cried out— " Monitors , collect the lesson-books and put them away !
" When it subsided , I saw them all drawn up in four semicircles , before four chairs , placed at the four tables ; all held books in their hands , and a great book , like a Bible , lay on each table , before the vacant seat .
" A great tumult succeeded for some minutes , during which Miss Miller repeatedly exclaimed , " Silence !
" Is she going by herself ?
I was carried into an inn , where the guard wanted me to have some dinner ; but , as I had no appetite , he left me in an immense room with a fireplace at each end , a chandelier pendent from the ceiling , and a little red gallery high up against the wall filled with musical instruments .
The indefatigable bell now sounded for the fourth time : the classes were marshalled and marched into another room to breakfast : how glad I was to behold a prospect of getting something to eat !

Lulled by the sound , I at last dropped asleep ;
The night passed rapidly .
I was too tired even to dream ;
I only once awoke to hear the wind rave in furious gusts , and the rain fall in torrents , and to be sensible that Miss Miller had taken her place by my side .
When I again unclosed my eyes , a loud bell was ringing ; the girls were up and dressing ; day had not yet begun to dawn , and a rushlight or two burned in the room .
I too rose reluctantly ; it was bitter cold , and I dressed as well as I could for shivering , and washed when there was a basin at liberty , which did not occur soon , as there was but one basin to six girls , on the stands down the middle of the room .
Again the bell rang : all formed in file , two and two , and in that order descended the stairs and entered the cold and dimly lit schoolroom : here prayers were read by Miss Miller ; afterwards she called out— " Form classes !
" A great tumult succeeded for some minutes , during which Miss Miller repeatedly exclaimed , " Silence !
" and " Order !
" When it subsided , I saw them all drawn up in four semicircles , before four chairs , placed at the four tables ; all held books in their hands , and a great book , like a Bible , lay on each table , before the vacant seat .
A pause of some seconds succeeded , filled up by the low , vague hum of numbers ;
Miss Miller walked from class to class , hushing this indefinite sound .
A distant bell tinkled : immediately three ladies entered the room , each walked to a table and took her seat .
Miss Miller assumed the fourth vacant chair , which was that nearest the door , and around which the smallest of the children were assembled : to this inferior class I was called , and placed at the bottom of it .
Business now began , the day 's Collect was repeated , then certain texts of Scripture were said , and to these succeeded a protracted reading of chapters in the Bible , which lasted an hour .
By the time that exercise was terminated , day had fully dawned .
The indefatigable bell now sounded for the fourth time : the classes were marshalled and marched into another room to breakfast : how glad I was to behold a prospect of getting something to eat !
I was now nearly sick from inanition , having taken so little the day before .
The refectory was a great , low-ceiled , gloomy room ; on two long tables smoked basins of something hot , which , however , to my dismay , sent forth an odour far from inviting .
I saw a universal manifestation of discontent when the fumes of the repast met the nostrils of those destined to swallow it ; from the van of the procession , the tall girls of the first class , rose the whispered words— " Disgusting !
The porridge is burnt again !
" " Silence !
" ejaculated a voice ; not that of Miss Miller , but one of the upper teachers , a little and dark personage , smartly dressed , but of somewhat morose aspect , who installed herself at the top of one table , while a more buxom lady presided at the other .
I looked in vain for her I had first seen the night before ; she was not visible : Miss Miller occupied the foot of the table where I sat , and a strange , foreign-looking , elderly lady , the French teacher , as I afterwards found , took the corresponding seat at the other board .
A long grace was said and a hymn sung ; then a servant brought in some tea for the teachers , and the meal began .
Ravenous , and now very faint , I devoured a spoonful or two of my portion without thinking of its taste ; but the first edge of hunger blunted , I perceived I had got in hand a nauseous mess ; burnt porridge is almost as bad as rotten potatoes ; famine itself soon sickens over it .
The spoons were moved slowly : I saw each girl taste her food and try to swallow it ; but in most cases the effort was soon relinquished .
Breakfast was over , and none had breakfasted .
Thanks being returned for what we had not got , and a second hymn chanted , the refectory was evacuated for the schoolroom .
I was one of the last to go out , and in passing the tables , I saw one teacher take a basin of the porridge and taste it ; she looked at the others ; all their countenances expressed displeasure , and one of them , the stout one , whispered— " Abominable stuff !
How shameful !
" A quarter of an hour passed before lessons again began , during which the schoolroom was in a glorious tumult ; for that space of time it seemed to be permitted to talk loud and more freely , and they used their privilege .
The whole conversation ran on the breakfast , which one and all abused roundly .
Poor things ! it was the sole consolation they had .
Miss Miller was now the only teacher in the room : a group of great girls standing about her spoke with serious and sullen gestures .
I heard the name of Mr. Brocklehurst pronounced by some lips ; at which Miss Miller shook her head disapprovingly ; but she made no great effort to check the general wrath ; doubtless she shared in it .
A clock in the schoolroom struck nine ;
Miss Miller left her circle , and standing in the middle of the room , cried— " Silence !
To your seats !
" Discipline prevailed : in five minutes the confused throng was resolved into order , and comparative silence quelled the Babel clamour of tongues .
The upper teachers now punctually resumed their posts : but still , all seemed to wait .
Ranged on benches down the sides of the room , the eighty girls sat motionless and erect ; a quaint assemblage they appeared , all with plain locks combed from their faces , not a curl visible ; in brown dresses , made high and surrounded by a narrow tucker about the throat , with little pockets of holland ( shaped something like a Highlander 's purse ) tied in front of their frocks , and destined to serve the purpose of a work-bag : all , too , wearing woollen stockings and country-made shoes , fastened with brass buckles .
Above twenty of those clad in this costume were full-grown girls , or rather young women ; it suited them ill , and gave an air of oddity even to the prettiest .
I was still looking at them , and also at intervals examining the teachers—none of whom precisely pleased me ; for the stout one was a little coarse , the dark one not a little fierce , the foreigner harsh and grotesque , and Miss Miller , poor thing ! looked purple , weather-beaten , and over-worked—when , as my eye wandered from face to face , the whole school rose simultaneously , as if moved by a common spring .
What was the matter ?
I had heard no order given : I was puzzled .
Ere I had gathered my wits , the classes were again seated : but as all eyes were now turned to one point , mine followed the general direction , and encountered the personage who had received me last night .
She stood at the bottom of the long room , on the hearth ; for there was a fire at each end ; she surveyed the two rows of girls silently and gravely .
Miss Miller approaching , seemed to ask her a question , and having received her answer , went back to her place , and said aloud— " Monitor of the first class , fetch the globes !
" While the direction was being executed , the lady consulted moved slowly up the room .
I suppose I have a considerable organ of veneration , for I retain yet the sense of admiring awe with which my eyes traced her steps .
Seen now , in broad daylight , she looked tall , fair , and shapely ; brown eyes with a benignant light in their irids , and a fine pencilling of long lashes round , relieved the whiteness of her large front ; on each of her temples her hair , of a very dark brown , was clustered in round curls , according to the fashion of those times , when neither smooth bands nor long ringlets were in vogue ; her dress , also in the mode of the day , was of purple cloth , relieved by a sort of Spanish trimming of black velvet ; a gold watch ( watches were not so common then as now ) shone at her girdle .
Let the reader add , to complete the picture , refined features ; a complexion , if pale , clear ; and a stately air and carriage , and he will have , at least , as clearly as words can give it , a correct idea of the exterior of Miss Temple—Maria Temple , as I afterwards saw the name written in a prayer-book intrusted to me to carry to church .
The superintendent of Lowood ( for such was this lady ) having taken her seat before a pair of globes placed on one of the tables , summoned the first class round her , and commenced giving a lesson on geography ; the lower classes were called by the teachers : repetitions in history , grammar , & c .
, went on for an hour ; writing and arithmetic succeeded , and music lessons were given by Miss Temple to some of the elder girls .
The duration of each lesson was measured by the clock , which at last struck twelve .
The superintendent rose— " I have a word to address to the pupils , " said she .
The tumult of cessation from lessons was already breaking forth , but it sank at her voice .
She went on— " You had this morning a breakfast which you could not eat ; you must be hungry : —I have ordered that a lunch of bread and cheese shall be served to all .
" The teachers looked at her with a sort of surprise .
" It is to be done on my responsibility , " she added , in an explanatory tone to them , and immediately afterwards left the room .
The bread and cheese was presently brought in and distributed , to the high delight and refreshment of the whole school .
The order was now given " To the garden !
" Each put on a coarse straw bonnet , with strings of coloured calico , and a cloak of grey frieze .
I was similarly equipped , and , following the stream , I made my way into the open air .
The garden was a wide inclosure , surrounded with walls so high as to exclude every glimpse of prospect ; a covered verandah ran down one side , and broad walks bordered a middle space divided into scores of little beds : these beds were assigned as gardens for the pupils to cultivate , and each bed had an owner .
When full of flowers they would doubtless look pretty ; but now , at the latter end of January , all was wintry blight and brown decay .
I shuddered as I stood and looked round me : it was an inclement day for outdoor exercise ; not positively rainy , but darkened by a drizzling yellow fog ; all under foot was still soaking wet with the floods of yesterday .
The stronger among the girls ran about and engaged in active games , but sundry pale and thin ones herded together for shelter and warmth in the verandah ; and amongst these , as the dense mist penetrated to their shivering frames , I heard frequently the sound of a hollow cough .
As yet I had spoken to no one , nor did anybody seem to take notice of me ; I stood lonely enough : but to that feeling of isolation I was accustomed ; it did not oppress me much .
I leant against a pillar of the verandah , drew my grey mantle close about me , and , trying to forget the cold which nipped me without , and the unsatisfied hunger which gnawed me within , delivered myself up to the employment of watching and thinking .
My reflections were too undefined and fragmentary to merit record : I hardly yet knew where I was ;
Gateshead and my past life seemed floated away to an immeasurable distance ; the present was vague and strange , and of the future I could form no conjecture .
I looked round the convent-like garden , and then up at the house—a large building , half of which seemed grey and old , the other half quite new .
The new part , containing the schoolroom and dormitory , was lit by mullioned and latticed windows , which gave it a church-like aspect ; a stone tablet over the door bore this inscription : — " Lowood Institution.—This portion was rebuilt A.D. — , by Naomi Brocklehurst , of Brocklehurst Hall , in this county .
" " Let your light so shine before men , that they may see your good works , and glorify your Father which is in heaven .
" —St .
Matt. v.
16 . I read these words over and over again : I felt that an explanation belonged to them , and was unable fully to penetrate their import .
I was still pondering the signification of " Institution , " and endeavouring to make out a connection between the first words and the verse of Scripture , when the sound of a cough close behind me made me turn my head .
I saw a girl sitting on a stone bench near ; she was bent over a book , on the perusal of which she seemed intent : from where I stood I could see the title—it was " Rasselas ;
" a name that struck me as strange , and consequently attractive .
In turning a leaf she happened to look up , and I said to her directly— " Is your book interesting ?
" I had already formed the intention of asking her to lend it to me some day .
" I like it , " she answered , after a pause of a second or two , during which she examined me .
" What is it about ?
" I continued .
I hardly know where I found the hardihood thus to open a conversation with a stranger ; the step was contrary to my nature and habits : but I think her occupation touched a chord of sympathy somewhere ; for I too liked reading , though of a frivolous and childish kind ;
I could not digest or comprehend the serious or substantial .
" You may look at it , " replied the girl , offering me the book .
I did so ; a brief examination convinced me that the contents were less taking than the title : " Rasselas " looked dull to my trifling taste ;
I saw nothing about fairies , nothing about genii ; no bright variety seemed spread over the closely-printed pages .
I returned it to her ; she received it quietly , and without saying anything she was about to relapse into her former studious mood : again I ventured to disturb her— " Can you tell me what the writing on that stone over the door means ?
What is Lowood Institution ?
" " This house where you are come to live .
" " And why do they call it Institution ?
Is it in any way different from other schools ?
" " It is partly a charity-school : you and I , and all the rest of us , are charity-children .
I suppose you are an orphan : are not either your father or your mother dead ?
" " Both died before I can remember .
" " Well , all the girls here have lost either one or both parents , and this is called an institution for educating orphans .
" " Do we pay no money ?
Do they keep us for nothing ?
" " We pay , or our friends pay , fifteen pounds a year for each .
" " Then why do they call us charity-children ?
" " Because fifteen pounds is not enough for board and teaching , and the deficiency is supplied by subscription .
" " Who subscribes ?
" " Different benevolent-minded ladies and gentlemen in this neighbourhood and in London .
" " Who was Naomi Brocklehurst ?
" " The lady who built the new part of this house as that tablet records , and whose son overlooks and directs everything here .
" " Why ?
" " Because he is treasurer and manager of the establishment .
" " Then this house does not belong to that tall lady who wears a watch , and who said we were to have some bread and cheese ?
" " To Miss Temple ?
Oh , no !
I wish it did : she has to answer to Mr. Brocklehurst for all she does .
Mr. Brocklehurst buys all our food and all our clothes .
" " Does he live here ?
" " No—two miles off , at a large hall .
" " Is he a good man ?
" " He is a clergyman , and is said to do a great deal of good .
" " Did you say that tall lady was called Miss Temple ?
" " Yes .
" " And what are the other teachers called ?
" " The one with red cheeks is called Miss Smith ; she attends to the work , and cuts out—for we make our own clothes , our frocks , and pelisses , and everything ; the little one with black hair is Miss Scatcherd ; she teaches history and grammar , and hears the second class repetitions ; and the one who wears a shawl , and has a pocket-handkerchief tied to her side with a yellow ribband , is Madame Pierrot : she comes from Lisle , in France , and teaches French .
" " Do you like the teachers ?
" " Well enough .
" " Do you like the little black one , and the Madame — ?
—I cannot pronounce her name as you do .
" " Miss Scatcherd is hasty—you must take care not to offend her ;
Madame Pierrot is not a bad sort of person .
" " But Miss Temple is the best—isn 't she ?
" " Miss Temple is very good and very clever ; she is above the rest , because she knows far more than they do .
" " Have you been long here ?
" " Two years .
" " Are you an orphan ?
" " My mother is dead .
" " Are you happy here ?
" " You ask rather too many questions .
I have given you answers enough for the present : now I want to read .
" But at that moment the summons sounded for dinner ; all re-entered the house .
The odour which now filled the refectory was scarcely more appetising than that which had regaled our nostrils at breakfast : the dinner was served in two huge tin-plated vessels , whence rose a strong steam redolent of rancid fat .
I found the mess to consist of indifferent potatoes and strange shreds of rusty meat , mixed and cooked together .
Of this preparation a tolerably abundant plateful was apportioned to each pupil .
I ate what I could , and wondered within myself whether every day 's fare would be like this .
After dinner , we immediately adjourned to the schoolroom : lessons recommenced , and were continued till five o 'clock .
The only marked event of the afternoon was , that I saw the girl with whom I had conversed in the verandah dismissed in disgrace by Miss Scatcherd from a history class , and sent to stand in the middle of the large schoolroom .
The punishment seemed to me in a high degree ignominious , especially for so great a girl—she looked thirteen or upwards .
I expected she would show signs of great distress and shame ; but to my surprise she neither wept nor blushed : composed , though grave , she stood , the central mark of all eyes .
" How can she bear it so quietly—so firmly ?
" I asked of myself .
" Were I in her place , it seems to me I should wish the earth to open and swallow me up .
She looks as if she were thinking of something beyond her punishment—beyond her situation : of something not round her nor before her .
I have heard of day-dreams—is she in a day-dream now ?
Her eyes are fixed on the floor , but I am sure they do not see it—her sight seems turned in , gone down into her heart : she is looking at what she can remember , I believe ; not at what is really present .
I wonder what sort of a girl she is—whether good or naughty .
" Soon after five p.m. we had another meal , consisting of a small mug of coffee , and half-a-slice of brown bread .
I devoured my bread and drank my coffee with relish ; but I should have been glad of as much more—I was still hungry .
Half-an-hour 's recreation succeeded , then study ; then the glass of water and the piece of oat-cake , prayers , and bed .
Such was my first day at Lowood .
The next day commenced as before , getting up and dressing by rushlight ; but this morning we were obliged to dispense with the ceremony of washing ; the water in the pitchers was frozen .
A change had taken place in the weather the preceding evening , and a keen north-east wind , whistling through the crevices of our bedroom windows all night long , had made us shiver in our beds , and turned the contents of the ewers to ice .
Before the long hour and a half of prayers and Bible-reading was over , I felt ready to perish with cold .
Breakfast-time came at last , and this morning the porridge was not burnt ; the quality was eatable , the quantity small .
How small my portion seemed !
I wished it had been doubled .
In the course of the day I was enrolled a member of the fourth class , and regular tasks and occupations were assigned me : hitherto , I had only been a spectator of the proceedings at Lowood ; I was now to become an actor therein .
At first , being little accustomed to learn by heart , the lessons appeared to me both long and difficult ; the frequent change from task to task , too , bewildered me ; and I was glad when , about three o 'clock in the afternoon , Miss Smith put into my hands a border of muslin two yards long , together with needle , thimble , & c .
, and sent me to sit in a quiet corner of the schoolroom , with directions to hem the same .
At that hour most of the others were sewing likewise ; but one class still stood round Miss Scatcherd 's chair reading , and as all was quiet , the subject of their lessons could be heard , together with the manner in which each girl acquitted herself , and the animadversions or commendations of Miss Scatcherd on the performance .
It was English history : among the readers I observed my acquaintance of the verandah : at the commencement of the lesson , her place had been at the top of the class , but for some error of pronunciation , or some inattention to stops , she was suddenly sent to the very bottom .
Even in that obscure position , Miss Scatcherd continued to make her an object of constant notice : she was continually addressing to her such phrases as the following : — " Burns " ( such it seems was her name : the girls here were all called by their surnames , as boys are elsewhere ) , " Burns , you are standing on the side of your shoe ; turn your toes out immediately .
" " Burns , you poke your chin most unpleasantly ; draw it in .
" " Burns , I insist on your holding your head up ;
I will not have you before me in that attitude , " A chapter having been read through twice , the books were closed and the girls examined .
The lesson had comprised part of the reign of Charles I. , and there were sundry questions about tonnage and poundage and ship- money , which most of them appeared unable to answer ; still , every little difficulty was solved instantly when it reached Burns : her memory seemed to have retained the substance of the whole lesson , and she was ready with answers on every point .
I kept expecting that Miss Scatcherd would praise her attention ; but , instead of that , she suddenly cried out— " You dirty , disagreeable girl ! you have never cleaned your nails this morning !
" Burns made no answer : I wondered at her silence .
" Why , " thought I , " does she not explain that she could neither clean her nails nor wash her face , as the water was frozen ?
" My attention was now called off by Miss Smith desiring me to hold a skein of thread : while she was winding it , she talked to me from time to time , asking whether I had ever been at school before , whether I could mark , stitch , knit , & c . ; till she dismissed me , I could not pursue my observations on Miss Scatcherd 's movements .
When I returned to my seat , that lady was just delivering an order of which I did not catch the import ; but Burns immediately left the class , and going into the small inner room where the books were kept , returned in half a minute , carrying in her hand a bundle of twigs tied together at one end .
This ominous tool she presented to Miss Scatcherd with a respectful curtesy ; then she quietly , and without being told , unloosed her pinafore , and the teacher instantly and sharply inflicted on her neck a dozen strokes with the bunch of twigs .
Not a tear rose to Burns ' eye ; and , while I paused from my sewing , because my fingers quivered at this spectacle with a sentiment of unavailing and impotent anger , not a feature of her pensive face altered its ordinary expression .
" Hardened girl !
" exclaimed Miss Scatcherd ;
" nothing can correct you of your slatternly habits : carry the rod away .
" Burns obeyed : I looked at her narrowly as she emerged from the book-closet ; she was just putting back her handkerchief into her pocket , and the trace of a tear glistened on her thin cheek .
The play-hour in the evening I thought the pleasantest fraction of the day at Lowood : the bit of bread , the draught of coffee swallowed at five o 'clock had revived vitality , if it had not satisfied hunger : the long restraint of the day was slackened ; the schoolroom felt warmer than in the morning—its fires being allowed to burn a little more brightly , to supply , in some measure , the place of candles , not yet introduced : the ruddy gloaming , the licensed uproar , the confusion of many voices gave one a welcome sense of liberty .
On the evening of the day on which I had seen Miss Scatcherd flog her pupil , Burns , I wandered as usual among the forms and tables and laughing groups without a companion , yet not feeling lonely : when I passed the windows , I now and then lifted a blind , and looked out ; it snowed fast , a drift was already forming against the lower panes ; putting my ear close to the window , I could distinguish from the gleeful tumult within , the disconsolate moan of the wind outside .
Probably , if I had lately left a good home and kind parents , this would have been the hour when I should most keenly have regretted the separation ; that wind would then have saddened my heart ; this obscure chaos would have disturbed my peace ! as it was , I derived from both a strange excitement , and reckless and feverish , I wished the wind to howl more wildly , the gloom to deepen to darkness , and the confusion to rise to clamour .
Jumping over forms , and creeping under tables , I made my way to one of the fire-places ; there , kneeling by the high wire fender , I found Burns , absorbed , silent , abstracted from all round her by the companionship of a book , which she read by the dim glare of the embers .
" Is it still ' Rasselas ' ?
" I asked , coming behind her .
" Yes , " she said , " and I have just finished it .
" And in five minutes more she shut it up .
I was glad of this .
" Now , " thought I , " I can perhaps get her to talk .
" I sat down by her on the floor .
" What is your name besides Burns ?
" " Helen .
" " Do you come a long way from here ?
" " I come from a place farther north , quite on the borders of Scotland .
" " Will you ever go back ?
" " I hope so ; but nobody can be sure of the future .
" " You must wish to leave Lowood ?
" " No ! why should I ?
I was sent to Lowood to get an education ; and it would be of no use going away until I have attained that object .
" " But that teacher , Miss Scatcherd , is so cruel to you ?
" " Cruel ?
Not at all !
She is severe : she dislikes my faults .
" " And if I were in your place I should dislike her ; I should resist her . If she struck me with that rod , I should get it from her hand ;
I should break it under her nose .
" " Probably you would do nothing of the sort : but if you did , Mr. Brocklehurst would expel you from the school ; that would be a great grief to your relations .
It is far better to endure patiently a smart which nobody feels but yourself , than to commit a hasty action whose evil consequences will extend to all connected with you ; and besides , the Bible bids us return good for evil .
" " But then it seems disgraceful to be flogged , and to be sent to stand in the middle of a room full of people ; and you are such a great girl : I am far younger than you , and I could not bear it .
" " Yet it would be your duty to bear it , if you could not avoid it : it is weak and silly to say you _ cannot bear _ what it is your fate to be required to bear .
" I heard her with wonder : I could not comprehend this doctrine of endurance ; and still less could I understand or sympathise with the forbearance she expressed for her chastiser .
Still I felt that Helen Burns considered things by a light invisible to my eyes .
I suspected she might be right and I wrong ; but I would not ponder the matter deeply ; like Felix , I put it off to a more convenient season .
" You say you have faults , Helen : what are they ?
To me you seem very good .
" " Then learn from me , not to judge by appearances : I am , as Miss Scatcherd said , slatternly ;
I seldom put , and never keep , things , in order ; I am careless ; I forget rules ; I read when I should learn my lessons ; I have no method ; and sometimes I say , like you , I cannot _ bear _ to be subjected to systematic arrangements .
This is all very provoking to Miss Scatcherd , who is naturally neat , punctual , and particular .
" " And cross and cruel , " I added ; but Helen Burns would not admit my addition : she kept silence .
" Is Miss Temple as severe to you as Miss Scatcherd ?
" At the utterance of Miss Temple 's name , a soft smile flitted over her grave face .
" Miss Temple is full of goodness ; it pains her to be severe to any one , even the worst in the school : she sees my errors , and tells me of them gently ; and , if I do anything worthy of praise , she gives me my meed liberally .
One strong proof of my wretchedly defective nature is , that even her expostulations , so mild , so rational , have not influence to cure me of my faults ; and even her praise , though I value it most highly , cannot stimulate me to continued care and foresight .
" " That is curious , " said I , " it is so easy to be careful .
" " For _ you _ I have no doubt it is .
I observed you in your class this morning , and saw you were closely attentive : your thoughts never seemed to wander while Miss Miller explained the lesson and questioned you .
Now , mine continually rove away ; when I should be listening to Miss Scatcherd , and collecting all she says with assiduity , often I lose the very sound of her voice ; I fall into a sort of dream .
Sometimes I think I am in Northumberland , and that the noises I hear round me are the bubbling of a little brook which runs through Deepden , near our house ; —then , when it comes to my turn to reply , I have to be awakened ; and having heard nothing of what was read for listening to the visionary brook , I have no answer ready .
" " Yet how well you replied this afternoon .
" " It was mere chance ; the subject on which we had been reading had interested me .
This afternoon , instead of dreaming of Deepden , I was wondering how a man who wished to do right could act so unjustly and unwisely as Charles the First sometimes did ; and I thought what a pity it was that , with his integrity and conscientiousness , he could see no farther than the prerogatives of the crown .
If he had but been able to look to a distance , and see how what they call the spirit of the age was tending !
Still , I like Charles—I respect him—I pity him , poor murdered king !
Yes , his enemies were the worst : they shed blood they had no right to shed .
How dared they kill him !
" Helen was talking to herself now : she had forgotten I could not very well understand her—that I was ignorant , or nearly so , of the subject she discussed .
I recalled her to my level .
" And when Miss Temple teaches you , do your thoughts wander then ?
" " No , certainly , not often ; because Miss Temple has generally something to say which is newer than my own reflections ; her language is singularly agreeable to me , and the information she communicates is often just what I wished to gain .
" " Well , then , with Miss Temple you are good ?
" " Yes , in a passive way : I make no effort ;
I follow as inclination guides me .
There is no merit in such goodness .
" " A great deal : you are good to those who are good to you .
It is all I ever desire to be .
If people were always kind and obedient to those who are cruel and unjust , the wicked people would have it all their own way : they would never feel afraid , and so they would never alter , but would grow worse and worse .
When we are struck at without a reason , we should strike back again very hard ;
I am sure we should—so hard as to teach the person who struck us never to do it again .
" " You will change your mind , I hope , when you grow older : as yet you are but a little untaught girl .
" " But I feel this , Helen ; I must dislike those who , whatever I do to please them , persist in disliking me ; I must resist those who punish me unjustly .
It is as natural as that I should love those who show me affection , or submit to punishment when I feel it is deserved .
" " Heathens and savage tribes hold that doctrine , but Christians and civilised nations disown it .
" " How ?
I don 't understand .
" " It is not violence that best overcomes hate—nor vengeance that most certainly heals injury .
" " What then ?
" " Read the New Testament , and observe what Christ says , and how He acts ; make His word your rule , and His conduct your example .
" " What does He say ?
" " Love your enemies ; bless them that curse you ; do good to them that hate you and despitefully use you .
" " Then I should love Mrs. Reed , which I cannot do ; I should bless her son John , which is impossible .
" In her turn , Helen Burns asked me to explain , and I proceeded forthwith to pour out , in my own way , the tale of my sufferings and resentments .
Bitter and truculent when excited , I spoke as I felt , without reserve or softening .
Helen heard me patiently to the end : I expected she would then make a remark , but she said nothing .
" Well , " I asked impatiently , " is not Mrs. Reed a hard-hearted , bad woman ?
" " She has been unkind to you , no doubt ; because you see , she dislikes your cast of character , as Miss Scatcherd does mine ; but how minutely you remember all she has done and said to you !
What a singularly deep impression her injustice seems to have made on your heart !
No ill-usage so brands its record on my feelings .
Would you not be happier if you tried to forget her severity , together with the passionate emotions it excited ?
Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity or registering wrongs .
We are , and must be , one and all , burdened with faults in this world : but the time will soon come when , I trust , we shall put them off in putting off our corruptible bodies ; when debasement and sin will fall from us with this cumbrous frame of flesh , and only the spark of the spirit will remain , —the impalpable principle of light and thought , pure as when it left the Creator to inspire the creature : whence it came it will return ; perhaps again to be communicated to some being higher than man—perhaps to pass through gradations of glory , from the pale human soul to brighten to the seraph !
Surely it will never , on the contrary , be suffered to degenerate from man to fiend ?
No ;
I cannot believe that : I hold another creed : which no one ever taught me , and which I seldom mention ; but in which I delight , and to which I cling : for it extends hope to all : it makes Eternity a rest—a mighty home , not a terror and an abyss .
Besides , with this creed , I can so clearly distinguish between the criminal and his crime ;
I can so sincerely forgive the first while I abhor the last : with this creed revenge never worries my heart , degradation never too deeply disgusts me , injustice never crushes me too low : I live in calm , looking to the end .
" Helen 's head , always drooping , sank a little lower as she finished this sentence .
I saw by her look she wished no longer to talk to me , but rather to converse with her own thoughts .
She was not allowed much time for meditation : a monitor , a great rough girl , presently came up , exclaiming in a strong Cumberland accent— " Helen Burns , if you don 't go and put your drawer in order , and fold up your work this minute , I 'll tell Miss Scatcherd to come and look at it !
" Helen sighed as her reverie fled , and getting up , obeyed the monitor without reply as without delay .
My first quarter at Lowood seemed an age ; and not the golden age either ; it comprised an irksome struggle with difficulties in habituating myself to new rules and unwonted tasks .
The fear of failure in these points harassed me worse than the physical hardships of my lot ; though these were no trifles .
During January , February , and part of March , the deep snows , and , after their melting , the almost impassable roads , prevented our stirring beyond the garden walls , except to go to church ; but within these limits we had to pass an hour every day in the open air .
Our clothing was insufficient to protect us from the severe cold : we had no boots , the snow got into our shoes and melted there : our ungloved hands became numbed and covered with chilblains , as were our feet : I remember well the distracting irritation I endured from this cause every evening , when my feet inflamed ; and the torture of thrusting the swelled , raw , and stiff toes into my shoes in the morning .
Then the scanty supply of food was distressing : with the keen appetites of growing children , we had scarcely sufficient to keep alive a delicate invalid .
From this deficiency of nourishment resulted an abuse , which pressed hardly on the younger pupils : whenever the famished great girls had an opportunity , they would coax or menace the little ones out of their portion .
Many a time I have shared between two claimants the precious morsel of brown bread distributed at tea-time ; and after relinquishing to a third half the contents of my mug of coffee , I have swallowed the remainder with an accompaniment of secret tears , forced from me by the exigency of hunger .
Sundays were dreary days in that wintry season .
We had to walk two miles to Brocklebridge Church , where our patron officiated .
We set out cold , we arrived at church colder : during the morning service we became almost paralysed .
It was too far to return to dinner , and an allowance of cold meat and bread , in the same penurious proportion observed in our ordinary meals , was served round between the services .
At the close of the afternoon service we returned by an exposed and hilly road , where the bitter winter wind , blowing over a range of snowy summits to the north , almost flayed the skin from our faces .
I can remember Miss Temple walking lightly and rapidly along our drooping line , her plaid cloak , which the frosty wind fluttered , gathered close about her , and encouraging us , by precept and example , to keep up our spirits , and march forward , as she said , " like stalwart soldiers .
" The other teachers , poor things , were generally themselves too much dejected to attempt the task of cheering others .
How we longed for the light and heat of a blazing fire when we got back !
But , to the little ones at least , this was denied : each hearth in the schoolroom was immediately surrounded by a double row of great girls , and behind them the younger children crouched in groups , wrapping their starved arms in their pinafores .
A little solace came at tea-time , in the shape of a double ration of bread—a whole , instead of a half , slice—with the delicious addition of a thin scrape of butter : it was the hebdomadal treat to which we all looked forward from Sabbath to Sabbath .
I generally contrived to reserve a moiety of this bounteous repast for myself ; but the remainder I was invariably obliged to part with .
The Sunday evening was spent in repeating , by heart , the Church Catechism , and the fifth , sixth , and seventh chapters of St.
Matthew ; and in listening to a long sermon , read by Miss Miller , whose irrepressible yawns attested her weariness .
A frequent interlude of these performances was the enactment of the part of Eutychus by some half-dozen of little girls , who , overpowered with sleep , would fall down , if not out of the third loft , yet off the fourth form , and be taken up half dead .
The remedy was , to thrust them forward into the centre of the schoolroom , and oblige them to stand there till the sermon was finished .
Sometimes their feet failed them , and they sank together in a heap ; they were then propped up with the monitors ' high stools .
I have not yet alluded to the visits of Mr. Brocklehurst ; and indeed that gentleman was from home during the greater part of the first month after my arrival ; perhaps prolonging his stay with his friend the archdeacon : his absence was a relief to me .
I need not say that I had my own reasons for dreading his coming : but come he did at last .
One afternoon ( I had then been three weeks at Lowood ) , as I was sitting with a slate in my hand , puzzling over a sum in long division , my eyes , raised in abstraction to the window , caught sight of a figure just passing : I recognised almost instinctively that gaunt outline ; and when , two minutes after , all the school , teachers included , rose _ en masse _ , it was not necessary for me to look up in order to ascertain whose entrance they thus greeted .
A long stride measured the schoolroom , and presently beside Miss Temple , who herself had risen , stood the same black column which had frowned on me so ominously from the hearthrug of Gateshead .
I now glanced sideways at this piece of architecture .
Yes , I was right : it was Mr. Brocklehurst , buttoned up in a surtout , and looking longer , narrower , and more rigid than ever .
I had my own reasons for being dismayed at this apparition ; too well I remembered the perfidious hints given by Mrs. Reed about my disposition , & c . ; the promise pledged by Mr. Brocklehurst to apprise Miss Temple and the teachers of my vicious nature .
All along I had been dreading the fulfilment of this promise , —I had been looking out daily for the " Coming Man , " whose information respecting my past life and conversation was to brand me as a bad child for ever : now there he was .
He stood at Miss Temple 's side ; he was speaking low in her ear : I did not doubt he was making disclosures of my villainy ; and I watched her eye with painful anxiety , expecting every moment to see its dark orb turn on me a glance of repugnance and contempt .
I listened too ; and as I happened to be seated quite at the top of the room , I caught most of what he said : its import relieved me from immediate apprehension .
" I suppose , Miss Temple , the thread I bought at Lowton will do ; it struck me that it would be just of the quality for the calico chemises , and I sorted the needles to match .
You may tell Miss Smith that I forgot to make a memorandum of the darning needles , but she shall have some papers sent in next week ; and she is not , on any account , to give out more than one at a time to each pupil : if they have more , they are apt to be careless and lose them .
And , O ma 'am !
I wish the woollen stockings were better looked to ! —when I was here last , I went into the kitchen-garden and examined the clothes drying on the line ; there was a quantity of black hose in a very bad state of repair : from the size of the holes in them I was sure they had not been well mended from time to time .
" He paused .
" Your directions shall be attended to , sir , " said Miss Temple .
" And , ma 'am , " he continued , " the laundress tells me some of the girls have two clean tuckers in the week : it is too much ; the rules limit them to one .
" " I think I can explain that circumstance , sir .
Agnes and Catherine Johnstone were invited to take tea with some friends at Lowton last Thursday , and I gave them leave to put on clean tuckers for the occasion .
" Mr. Brocklehurst nodded .
" Well , for once it may pass ; but please not to let the circumstance occur too often .
And there is another thing which surprised me ;
I find , in settling accounts with the housekeeper , that a lunch , consisting of bread and cheese , has twice been served out to the girls during the past fortnight .
How is this ?
I looked over the regulations , and I find no such meal as lunch mentioned .
Who introduced this innovation ? and by what authority ?
" " I must be responsible for the circumstance , sir , " replied Miss Temple : " the breakfast was so ill prepared that the pupils could not possibly eat it ; and I dared not allow them to remain fasting till dinner-time .
" " Madam , allow me an instant .
You are aware that my plan in bringing up these girls is , not to accustom them to habits of luxury and indulgence , but to render them hardy , patient , self-denying .
Should any little accidental disappointment of the appetite occur , such as the spoiling of a meal , the under or the over dressing of a dish , the incident ought not to be neutralised by replacing with something more delicate the comfort lost , thus pampering the body and obviating the aim of this institution ; it ought to be improved to the spiritual edification of the pupils , by encouraging them to evince fortitude under temporary privation .
A brief address on those occasions would not be mistimed , wherein a judicious instructor would take the opportunity of referring to the sufferings of the primitive Christians ; to the torments of martyrs ; to the exhortations of our blessed Lord Himself , calling upon His disciples to take up their cross and follow Him ; to His warnings that man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God ; to His divine consolations , " If ye suffer hunger or thirst for My sake , happy are ye .
" Oh , madam , when you put bread and cheese , instead of burnt porridge , into these children 's mouths , you may indeed feed their vile bodies , but you little think how you starve their immortal souls !
" Mr. Brocklehurst again paused—perhaps overcome by his feelings .
Miss Temple had looked down when he first began to speak to her ; but she now gazed straight before her , and her face , naturally pale as marble , appeared to be assuming also the coldness and fixity of that material ; especially her mouth , closed as if it would have required a sculptor 's chisel to open it , and her brow settled gradually into petrified severity .
Meantime , Mr. Brocklehurst , standing on the hearth with his hands behind his back , majestically surveyed the whole school .
Suddenly his eye gave a blink , as if it had met something that either dazzled or shocked its pupil ; turning , he said in more rapid accents than he had hitherto used— " Miss Temple , Miss Temple , what— _ what _ is that girl with curled hair ?
Red hair , ma 'am , curled—curled all over ?
" And extending his cane he pointed to the awful object , his hand shaking as he did so .
" It is Julia Severn , " replied Miss Temple , very quietly .
" Julia Severn , ma 'am !
And why has she , or any other , curled hair ?
Why , in defiance of every precept and principle of this house , does she conform to the world so openly—here in an evangelical , charitable establishment—as to wear her hair one mass of curls ?
" " Julia 's hair curls naturally , " returned Miss Temple , still more quietly .
" Naturally !
Yes , but we are not to conform to nature ;
I wish these girls to be the children of Grace : and why that abundance ?
I have again and again intimated that I desire the hair to be arranged closely , modestly , plainly .
Miss Temple , that girl 's hair must be cut off entirely ; I will send a barber to-morrow : and I see others who have far too much of the excrescence—that tall girl , tell her to turn round .
Tell all the first form to rise up and direct their faces to the wall .
" Miss Temple passed her handkerchief over her lips , as if to smooth away the involuntary smile that curled them ; she gave the order , however , and when the first class could take in what was required of them , they obeyed .
Leaning a little back on my bench , I could see the looks and grimaces with which they commented on this manoeuvre : it was a pity Mr. Brocklehurst could not see them too ; he would perhaps have felt that , whatever he might do with the outside of the cup and platter , the inside was further beyond his interference than he imagined .
He scrutinised the reverse of these living medals some five minutes , then pronounced sentence .
These words fell like the knell of doom— " All those top-knots must be cut off .
" Miss Temple seemed to remonstrate .
" Madam , " he pursued , " I have a Master to serve whose kingdom is not of this world : my mission is to mortify in these girls the lusts of the flesh ; to teach them to clothe themselves with shame-facedness and sobriety , not with braided hair and costly apparel ; and each of the young persons before us has a string of hair twisted in plaits which vanity itself might have woven ; these , I repeat , must be cut off ; think of the time wasted , of— " Mr. Brocklehurst was here interrupted : three other visitors , ladies , now entered the room .
They ought to have come a little sooner to have heard his lecture on dress , for they were splendidly attired in velvet , silk , and furs .
The two younger of the trio ( fine girls of sixteen and seventeen ) had grey beaver hats , then in fashion , shaded with ostrich plumes , and from under the brim of this graceful head-dress fell a profusion of light tresses , elaborately curled ; the elder lady was enveloped in a costly velvet shawl , trimmed with ermine , and she wore a false front of French curls .
These ladies were deferentially received by Miss Temple , as Mrs. and the Misses Brocklehurst , and conducted to seats of honour at the top of the room .
It seems they had come in the carriage with their reverend relative , and had been conducting a rummaging scrutiny of the room upstairs , while he transacted business with the housekeeper , questioned the laundress , and lectured the superintendent .
They now proceeded to address divers remarks and reproofs to Miss Smith , who was charged with the care of the linen and the inspection of the dormitories : but I had no time to listen to what they said ; other matters called off and enchanted my attention .
Hitherto , while gathering up the discourse of Mr. Brocklehurst and Miss Temple , I had not , at the same time , neglected precautions to secure my personal safety ; which I thought would be effected , if I could only elude observation .
To this end , I had sat well back on the form , and while seeming to be busy with my sum , had held my slate in such a manner as to conceal my face : I might have escaped notice , had not my treacherous slate somehow happened to slip from my hand , and falling with an obtrusive crash , directly drawn every eye upon me ;
I knew it was all over now , and , as I stooped to pick up the two fragments of slate , I rallied my forces for the worst .
It came .
" A careless girl !
" said Mr. Brocklehurst , and immediately after— " It is the new pupil , I perceive .
" And before I could draw breath , " I must not forget I have a word to say respecting her .
" Then aloud : how loud it seemed to me !
" Let the child who broke her slate come forward !
" Of my own accord I could not have stirred ; I was paralysed : but the two great girls who sit on each side of me , set me on my legs and pushed me towards the dread judge , and then Miss Temple gently assisted me to his very feet , and I caught her whispered counsel— " Don 't be afraid , Jane , I saw it was an accident ; you shall not be punished .
" The kind whisper went to my heart like a dagger .
" Another minute , and she will despise me for a hypocrite , " thought I ; and an impulse of fury against Reed , Brocklehurst , and Co. bounded in my pulses at the conviction .
I was no Helen Burns .
" Fetch that stool , " said Mr. Brocklehurst , pointing to a very high one from which a monitor had just risen : it was brought .
" Place the child upon it .
" And I was placed there , by whom I don 't know : I was in no condition to note particulars ;
I was only aware that they had hoisted me up to the height of Mr. Brocklehurst 's nose , that he was within a yard of me , and that a spread of shot orange and purple silk pelisses and a cloud of silvery plumage extended and waved below me .
Mr. Brocklehurst hemmed .
" Ladies , " said he , turning to his family , " Miss Temple , teachers , and children , you all see this girl ?
" Of course they did ; for I felt their eyes directed like burning-glasses against my scorched skin .
" You see she is yet young ; you observe she possesses the ordinary form of childhood ;
God has graciously given her the shape that He has given to all of us ; no signal deformity points her out as a marked character .
Who would think that the Evil One had already found a servant and agent in her ?
Yet such , I grieve to say , is the case .
" A pause—in which I began to steady the palsy of my nerves , and to feel that the Rubicon was passed ; and that the trial , no longer to be shirked , must be firmly sustained .
" My dear children , " pursued the black marble clergyman , with pathos , " this is a sad , a melancholy occasion ; for it becomes my duty to warn you , that this girl , who might be one of God 's own lambs , is a little castaway : not a member of the true flock , but evidently an interloper and an alien .
" " Jane , you are mistaken : probably not one in the school either despises or dislikes you : many , I am sure , pity you much .
" And now tell me who is the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress ?
" This I learned from her benefactress ; from the pious and charitable lady who adopted her in her orphan state , reared her as her own daughter , and whose kindness , whose generosity the unhappy girl repaid by an ingratitude so bad , so dreadful , that at last her excellent patroness was obliged to separate her from her own young ones , fearful lest her vicious example should contaminate their purity : she has sent her here to be healed , even as the Jews of old sent their diseased to the troubled pool of Bethesda ; and , teachers , superintendent , I beg of you not to allow the waters to stagnate round her .
" There was I , then , mounted aloft ;
What my sensations were no language can describe ; but just as they all rose , stifling my breath and constricting my throat , a girl came up and passed me : in passing , she lifted her eyes .
" " How can they pity me after what Mr. Brocklehurst has said ?
" I resolved , in the depth of my heart , that I would be most moderate—most correct ; and , having reflected a few minutes in order to arrange coherently what I had to say , I told her all the story of my sad childhood .
" Barbara went out : she returned soon— " Madam , Mrs. Harden says she has sent up the usual quantity .
" " Jane , you are mistaken : probably not one in the school either despises or dislikes you : many , I am sure , pity you much .
" " How can they pity me after what Mr. Brocklehurst has said ?
Ere the half-hour ended , five o 'clock struck ; school was dismissed , and all were gone into the refectory to tea .
She was pensive a few minutes , then rousing herself , she said cheerfully— " But you two are my visitors to-night ;
" I resolved , in the depth of my heart , that I would be most moderate—most correct ; and , having reflected a few minutes in order to arrange coherently what I had to say , I told her all the story of my sad childhood .
I felt the impression of woe as she spoke , but I could not tell whence it came ; and when , having done speaking , she breathed a little fast and coughed a short cough , I momentarily forgot my own sorrows to yield to a vague concern for her .
" she asked , looking down at my face .
How pretty , to my eyes , did the china cups and bright teapot look , placed on the little round table near the fire !
What stores of knowledge they possessed !
What stores of knowledge they possessed !
The refreshing meal , the brilliant fire , the presence and kindness of her beloved instructress , or , perhaps , more than all these , something in her own unique mind , had roused her powers within her .
Resting my head on Helen 's shoulder , I put my arms round her waist ; she drew me to her , and we reposed in silence .
Miss Temple told Helen Burns to be seated in a low arm-chair on one side of the hearth , and herself taking another , she called me to her side .
" Oh , very well !
They woke , they kindled : first , they glowed in the bright tint of her cheek , which till this hour I had never seen but pale and bloodless ; then they shone in the liquid lustre of her eyes , which had suddenly acquired a beauty more singular than that of Miss Temple 's—a beauty neither of fine colour nor long eyelash , nor pencilled brow , but of meaning , of movement , of radiance .
" Next morning , Miss Scatcherd wrote in conspicuous characters on a piece of pasteboard the word " Slattern , " and bound it like a phylactery round Helen 's large , mild , intelligent , and benign-looking forehead .
" Oh , very well !
" Next morning , Miss Scatcherd wrote in conspicuous characters on a piece of pasteboard the word " Slattern , " and bound it like a phylactery round Helen 's large , mild , intelligent , and benign-looking forehead .
She had scarcely finished ere the bell announced bedtime ! no delay could be admitted ;
" Is it all over ?
" I was silent ;
" I was silent ;
Thus restrained and simplified , it sounded more credible : I felt as I went on that Miss Temple fully believed me .
I know I should think well of myself ; but that is not enough : if others don 't love me I would rather die than live—I cannot bear to be solitary and hated , Helen .
I know I should think well of myself ; but that is not enough : if others don 't love me I would rather die than live—I cannot bear to be solitary and hated , Helen .
Thus relieved of a grievous load , I from that hour set to work afresh , resolved to pioneer my way through every difficulty : I toiled hard , and my success was proportionate to my efforts ; my memory , not naturally tenacious , improved with practice ; exercise sharpened my wits ; in a few weeks I was promoted to a higher class ; in less than two months I was allowed to commence French and drawing .

The teachers then shook hands with me and kissed me , and a murmur of pleasure ran through the ranks of my companions .
" " I am afraid I never shall do that .
" " I am afraid I never shall do that .
" Having invited Helen and me to approach the table , and placed before each of us a cup of tea with one delicious but thin morsel of toast , she got up , unlocked a drawer , and taking from it a parcel wrapped in paper , disclosed presently to our eyes a good-sized seed-cake .
" I meant to give each of you some of this to take with you , " said she , " but as there is so little toast , you must have it now , " and she proceeded to cut slices with a generous hand .
" My things were indeed in shameful disorder , " murmured Helen to me , in a low voice : " I intended to have arranged them , but I forgot .
" Have you cried your grief away ?
" Miss Temple got up , took her hand and examined her pulse ; then she returned to her own seat : as she resumed it , I heard her sigh low .
" How are you to-night , Helen ?
" How are you to-night , Helen ?
" And now tell me who is the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress ?
" " Why ?
What stores of knowledge they possessed !
" " Well now , Jane , you know , or at least I will tell you , that when a criminal is accused , he is always allowed to speak in his own defence .
" And now tell me who is the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress ?
" " Mr. Brocklehurst is not a god : nor is he even a great and admired man : he is little liked here ; he never took steps to make himself liked .
Had he treated you as an especial favourite , you would have found enemies , declared or covert , all around you ; as it is , the greater number would offer you sympathy if they dared .
Teachers and pupils may look coldly on you for a day or two , but friendly feelings are concealed in their hearts ; and if you persevere in doing well , these feelings will ere long appear so much the more evidently for their temporary suppression .
Besides , Jane " —she paused .
" Well , Helen ?
" said I , putting my hand into hers : she chafed my fingers gently to warm them , and went on— " If all the world hated you , and believed you wicked , while your own conscience approved you , and absolved you from guilt , you would not be without friends .
" " No ; I know I should think well of myself ; but that is not enough : if others don 't love me I would rather die than live—I cannot bear to be solitary and hated , Helen .
Look here ; to gain some real affection from you , or Miss Temple , or any other whom I truly love , I would willingly submit to have the bone of my arm broken , or to let a bull toss me , or to stand behind a kicking horse , and let it dash its hoof at my chest— " " Hush , Jane ! you think too much of the love of human beings ; you are too impulsive , too vehement ; the sovereign hand that created your frame , and put life into it , has provided you with other resources than your feeble self , or than creatures feeble as you .
Besides this earth , and besides the race of men , there is an invisible world and a kingdom of spirits : that world is round us , for it is everywhere ; and those spirits watch us , for they are commissioned to guard us ; and if we were dying in pain and shame , if scorn smote us on all sides , and hatred crushed us , angels see our tortures , recognise our innocence ( if innocent we be : as I know you are of this charge which Mr. Brocklehurst has weakly and pompously repeated at second-hand from Mrs. Reed ; for I read a sincere nature in your ardent eyes and on your clear front ) , and God waits only the separation of spirit from flesh to crown us with a full reward .
Why , then , should we ever sink overwhelmed with distress , when life is so soon over , and death is so certain an entrance to happiness—to glory ?
" I was silent ;
Helen had calmed me ; but in the tranquillity she imparted there was an alloy of inexpressible sadness .
I felt the impression of woe as she spoke , but I could not tell whence it came ; and when , having done speaking , she breathed a little fast and coughed a short cough , I momentarily forgot my own sorrows to yield to a vague concern for her .
Resting my head on Helen 's shoulder , I put my arms round her waist ; she drew me to her , and we reposed in silence .
We had not sat long thus , when another person came in .
Some heavy clouds , swept from the sky by a rising wind , had left the moon bare ; and her light , streaming in through a window near , shone full both on us and on the approaching figure , which we at once recognised as Miss Temple .
" I came on purpose to find you , Jane Eyre , " said she ;
" I want you in my room ; and as Helen Burns is with you , she may come too .
" We went ; following the superintendent 's guidance , we had to thread some intricate passages , and mount a staircase before we reached her apartment ; it contained a good fire , and looked cheerful .
Miss Temple told Helen Burns to be seated in a low arm-chair on one side of the hearth , and herself taking another , she called me to her side .
" Is it all over ?
" she asked , looking down at my face .
" Have you cried your grief away ?
" " I am afraid I never shall do that .
" " Why ?
" " Because I have been wrongly accused ; and you , ma 'am , and everybody else , will now think me wicked .
" " We shall think you what you prove yourself to be , my child .
Continue to act as a good girl , and you will satisfy us .
" " Shall I , Miss Temple ?
" " You will , " said she , passing her arm round me .
" And now tell me who is the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress ?
" " Mrs. Reed , my uncle 's wife .
My uncle is dead , and he left me to her care .
" " Did she not , then , adopt you of her own accord ?
" " No , ma 'am ; she was sorry to have to do it : but my uncle , as I have often heard the servants say , got her to promise before he died that she would always keep me .
" " Well now , Jane , you know , or at least I will tell you , that when a criminal is accused , he is always allowed to speak in his own defence .
You have been charged with falsehood ; defend yourself to me as well as you can .
Say whatever your memory suggests is true ; but add nothing and exaggerate nothing .
" I resolved , in the depth of my heart , that I would be most moderate—most correct ; and , having reflected a few minutes in order to arrange coherently what I had to say , I told her all the story of my sad childhood .
Exhausted by emotion , my language was more subdued than it generally was when it developed that sad theme ; and mindful of Helen 's warnings against the indulgence of resentment , I infused into the narrative far less of gall and wormwood than ordinary .
Thus restrained and simplified , it sounded more credible : I felt as I went on that Miss Temple fully believed me .
In the course of the tale I had mentioned Mr. Lloyd as having come to see me after the fit : for I never forgot the , to me , frightful episode of the red-room : in detailing which , my excitement was sure , in some degree , to break bounds ; for nothing could soften in my recollection the spasm of agony which clutched my heart when Mrs. Reed spurned my wild supplication for pardon , and locked me a second time in the dark and haunted chamber .
I had finished : Miss Temple regarded me a few minutes in silence ; she then said— " I know something of Mr. Lloyd ;
I shall write to him ; if his reply agrees with your statement , you shall be publicly cleared from every imputation ; to me , Jane , you are clear now .
" She kissed me , and still keeping me at her side ( where I was well contented to stand , for I derived a child 's pleasure from the contemplation of her face , her dress , her one or two ornaments , her white forehead , her clustered and shining curls , and beaming dark eyes ) , she proceeded to address Helen Burns .
" How are you to-night , Helen ?
Have you coughed much to-day ?
" " Not quite so much , I think , ma 'am .
" " And the pain in your chest ?
" " It is a little better .
" Miss Temple got up , took her hand and examined her pulse ; then she returned to her own seat : as she resumed it , I heard her sigh low .
She was pensive a few minutes , then rousing herself , she said cheerfully— " But you two are my visitors to-night ; I must treat you as such .
" She rang her bell .
" Barbara , " she said to the servant who answered it , " I have not yet had tea ; bring the tray and place cups for these two young ladies .
" And a tray was soon brought .
How pretty , to my eyes , did the china cups and bright teapot look , placed on the little round table near the fire !
How fragrant was the steam of the beverage , and the scent of the toast ! of which , however , I , to my dismay ( for I was beginning to be hungry ) discerned only a very small portion : Miss Temple discerned it too .
" Barbara , " said she , " can you not bring a little more bread and butter ?
There is not enough for three .
" Barbara went out : she returned soon— " Madam , Mrs. Harden says she has sent up the usual quantity .
" Mrs. Harden , be it observed , was the housekeeper : a woman after Mr. Brocklehurst 's own heart , made up of equal parts of whalebone and iron .
" Oh , very well !
" returned Miss Temple ;
" we must make it do , Barbara , I suppose .
" And as the girl withdrew she added , smiling , " Fortunately , I have it in my power to supply deficiencies for this once .
" Having invited Helen and me to approach the table , and placed before each of us a cup of tea with one delicious but thin morsel of toast , she got up , unlocked a drawer , and taking from it a parcel wrapped in paper , disclosed presently to our eyes a good-sized seed-cake .
" I meant to give each of you some of this to take with you , " said she , " but as there is so little toast , you must have it now , " and she proceeded to cut slices with a generous hand .
We feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia ; and not the least delight of the entertainment was the smile of gratification with which our hostess regarded us , as we satisfied our famished appetites on the delicate fare she liberally supplied .
Tea over and the tray removed , she again summoned us to the fire ; we sat one on each side of her , and now a conversation followed between her and Helen , which it was indeed a privilege to be admitted to hear .
Miss Temple had always something of serenity in her air , of state in her mien , of refined propriety in her language , which precluded deviation into the ardent , the excited , the eager : something which chastened the pleasure of those who looked on her and listened to her , by a controlling sense of awe ; and such was my feeling now : but as to Helen Burns , I was struck with wonder .
The refreshing meal , the brilliant fire , the presence and kindness of her beloved instructress , or , perhaps , more than all these , something in her own unique mind , had roused her powers within her .
They woke , they kindled : first , they glowed in the bright tint of her cheek , which till this hour I had never seen but pale and bloodless ; then they shone in the liquid lustre of her eyes , which had suddenly acquired a beauty more singular than that of Miss Temple 's—a beauty neither of fine colour nor long eyelash , nor pencilled brow , but of meaning , of movement , of radiance .
Then her soul sat on her lips , and language flowed , from what source I cannot tell . Has a girl of fourteen a heart large enough , vigorous enough , to hold the swelling spring of pure , full , fervid eloquence ?
Such was the characteristic of Helen 's discourse on that , to me , memorable evening ; her spirit seemed hastening to live within a very brief span as much as many live during a protracted existence .
They conversed of things I had never heard of ; of nations and times past ; of countries far away ; of secrets of nature discovered or guessed at : they spoke of books : how many they had read !
What stores of knowledge they possessed !
Then they seemed so familiar with French names and French authors : but my amazement reached its climax when Miss Temple asked Helen if she sometimes snatched a moment to recall the Latin her father had taught her , and taking a book from a shelf , bade her read and construe a page of Virgil ; and Helen obeyed , my organ of veneration expanding at every sounding line .
She had scarcely finished ere the bell announced bedtime ! no delay could be admitted ;
Miss Temple embraced us both , saying , as she drew us to her heart— " God bless you , my children !
" Helen she held a little longer than me : she let her go more reluctantly ; it was Helen her eye followed to the door ; it was for her she a second time breathed a sad sigh ; for her she wiped a tear from her cheek .
On reaching the bedroom , we heard the voice of Miss Scatcherd : she was examining drawers ; she had just pulled out Helen Burns 's , and when we entered Helen was greeted with a sharp reprimand , and told that to-morrow she should have half-a-dozen of untidily folded articles pinned to her shoulder .
" My things were indeed in shameful disorder , " murmured Helen to me , in a low voice : " I intended to have arranged them , but I forgot .
" Next morning , Miss Scatcherd wrote in conspicuous characters on a piece of pasteboard the word " Slattern , " and bound it like a phylactery round Helen 's large , mild , intelligent , and benign-looking forehead .
She wore it till evening , patient , unresentful , regarding it as a deserved punishment .
The moment Miss Scatcherd withdrew after afternoon school , I ran to Helen , tore it off , and thrust it into the fire : the fury of which she was incapable had been burning in my soul all day , and tears , hot and large , had continually been scalding my cheek ; for the spectacle of her sad resignation gave me an intolerable pain at the heart .
About a week subsequently to the incidents above narrated , Miss Temple , who had written to Mr. Lloyd , received his answer : it appeared that what he said went to corroborate my account .
Miss Temple , having assembled the whole school , announced that inquiry had been made into the charges alleged against Jane Eyre , and that she was most happy to be able to pronounce her completely cleared from every imputation .
The teachers then shook hands with me and kissed me , and a murmur of pleasure ran through the ranks of my companions .
Thus relieved of a grievous load , I from that hour set to work afresh , resolved to pioneer my way through every difficulty : I toiled hard , and my success was proportionate to my efforts ; my memory , not naturally tenacious , improved with practice ; exercise sharpened my wits ; in a few weeks I was promoted to a higher class ; in less than two months I was allowed to commence French and drawing .
I learned the first two tenses of the verb _ Etre _ , and sketched my first cottage ( whose walls , by-the- bye , outrivalled in slope those of the leaning tower of Pisa ) , on the same day .
That night , on going to bed , I forgot to prepare in imagination the Barmecide supper of hot roast potatoes , or white bread and new milk , with which I was wont to amuse my inward cravings : I feasted instead on the spectacle of ideal drawings , which I saw in the dark ; all the work of my own hands : freely pencilled houses and trees , picturesque rocks and ruins , Cuyp-like groups of cattle , sweet paintings of butterflies hovering over unblown roses , of birds picking at ripe cherries , of wren 's nests enclosing pearl-like eggs , wreathed about with young ivy sprays .
I examined , too , in thought , the possibility of my ever being able to translate currently a certain little French story which Madame Pierrot had that day shown me ; nor was that problem solved to my satisfaction ere I fell sweetly asleep .
Well has Solomon said— " Better is a dinner of herbs where love is , than a stalled ox and hatred therewith .
" I would not now have exchanged Lowood with all its privations for Gateshead and its daily luxuries .
But the privations , or rather the hardships , of Lowood lessened .
Spring drew on : she was indeed already come ; the frosts of winter had ceased ; its snows were melted , its cutting winds ameliorated .
My wretched feet , flayed and swollen to lameness by the sharp air of January , began to heal and subside under the gentler breathings of April ; the nights and mornings no longer by their Canadian temperature froze the very blood in our veins ; we could now endure the play-hour passed in the garden : sometimes on a sunny day it began even to be pleasant and genial , and a greenness grew over those brown beds , which , freshening daily , suggested the thought that Hope traversed them at night , and left each morning brighter traces of her steps .
Flowers peeped out amongst the leaves ; snow-drops , crocuses , purple auriculas , and golden-eyed pansies .
On Thursday afternoons ( half-holidays ) we now took walks , and found still sweeter flowers opening by the wayside , under the hedges .
I discovered , too , that a great pleasure , an enjoyment which the horizon only bounded , lay all outside the high and spike-guarded walls of our garden : this pleasure consisted in prospect of noble summits girdling a great hill-hollow , rich in verdure and shadow ; in a bright beck , full of dark stones and sparkling eddies .
How different had this scene looked when I viewed it laid out beneath the iron sky of winter , stiffened in frost , shrouded with snow ! —when mists as chill as death wandered to the impulse of east winds along those purple peaks , and rolled down " ing " and holm till they blended with the frozen fog of the beck !
That beck itself was then a torrent , turbid and curbless : it tore asunder the wood , and sent a raving sound through the air , often thickened with wild rain or whirling sleet ; and for the forest on its banks , _ that _ showed only ranks of skeletons .
April advanced to May : a bright serene May it was ; days of blue sky , placid sunshine , and soft western or southern gales filled up its duration .
And now vegetation matured with vigour ;
Lowood shook loose its tresses ; it became all green , all flowery ; its great elm , ash , and oak skeletons were restored to majestic life ; woodland plants sprang up profusely in its recesses ; unnumbered varieties of moss filled its hollows , and it made a strange ground-sunshine out of the wealth of its wild primrose plants : I have seen their pale gold gleam in overshadowed spots like scatterings of the sweetest lustre .
All this I enjoyed often and fully , free , unwatched , and almost alone : for this unwonted liberty and pleasure there was a cause , to which it now becomes my task to advert .
Have I not described a pleasant site for a dwelling , when I speak of it as bosomed in hill and wood , and rising from the verge of a stream ?
Assuredly , pleasant enough : but whether healthy or not is another question .
That forest-dell , where Lowood lay , was the cradle of fog and fog-bred pestilence ; which , quickening with the quickening spring , crept into the Orphan Asylum , breathed typhus through its crowded schoolroom and dormitory , and , ere May arrived , transformed the seminary into an hospital .
Semi-starvation and neglected colds had predisposed most of the pupils to receive infection : forty-five out of the eighty girls lay ill at one time .
Classes were broken up , rules relaxed .
The few who continued well were allowed almost unlimited license ; because the medical attendant insisted on the necessity of frequent exercise to keep them in health : and had it been otherwise , no one had leisure to watch or restrain them .
Miss Temple 's whole attention was absorbed by the patients : she lived in the sick-room , never quitting it except to snatch a few hours ' rest at night .
The teachers were fully occupied with packing up and making other necessary preparations for the departure of those girls who were fortunate enough to have friends and relations able and willing to remove them from the seat of contagion .
Many , already smitten , went home only to die : some died at the school , and were buried quietly and quickly , the nature of the malady forbidding delay .
While disease had thus become an inhabitant of Lowood , and death its frequent visitor ; while there was gloom and fear within its walls ; while its rooms and passages steamed with hospital smells , the drug and the pastille striving vainly to overcome the effluvia of mortality , that bright May shone unclouded over the bold hills and beautiful woodland out of doors .
Its garden , too , glowed with flowers : hollyhocks had sprung up tall as trees , lilies had opened , tulips and roses were in bloom ; the borders of the little beds were gay with pink thrift and crimson double daisies ; the sweetbriars gave out , morning and evening , their scent of spice and apples ; and these fragrant treasures were all useless for most of the inmates of Lowood , except to furnish now and then a handful of herbs and blossoms to put in a coffin .
But I , and the rest who continued well , enjoyed fully the beauties of the scene and season ; they let us ramble in the wood , like gipsies , from morning till night ; we did what we liked , went where we liked : we lived better too .
Mr. Brocklehurst and his family never came near Lowood now : household matters were not scrutinised into ; the cross housekeeper was gone , driven away by the fear of infection ; her successor , who had been matron at the Lowton Dispensary , unused to the ways of her new abode , provided with comparative liberality .
The stone was just broad enough to accommodate , comfortably , another girl and me , at that time my chosen comrade—one Mary Ann Wilson ; a shrewd , observant personage , whose society I took pleasure in , partly because she was witty and original , and partly because she had a manner which set me at my ease .

Surely the Mary Ann Wilson I have mentioned was inferior to my first acquaintance : she could only tell me amusing stories , and reciprocate any racy and pungent gossip I chose to indulge in ; while , if I have spoken truth of Helen , she was qualified to give those who enjoyed the privilege of her converse a taste of far higher things .

I had the means of an excellent education placed within my reach ; a fondness for some of my studies , and a desire to excel in all , together with a great delight in pleasing my teachers , especially such as I loved , urged me on : I availed myself fully of the advantages offered me .
" How is Helen Burns ?
How could it be otherwise , when Helen , at all times and under all circumstances , evinced for me a quiet and faithful friendship , which ill-humour never soured , nor irritation never troubled ?
" May I go up and speak to her ?
I had not qualities or talents to make my way very well in the world : I should have been continually at fault .

" How is Helen Burns ?
I should not have suspected that it meant she was dying ; but I knew instantly now !
Miss Temple was not to be seen : I knew afterwards that she had been called to a delirious patient in the fever-room .
I was not reprimanded for leaving my bed ; people had something else to think about ; no explanation was afforded then to my many questions ; but a day or two afterwards I learned that Miss Temple , on returning to her own room at dawn , had found me laid in the little crib ; my face against Helen Burns 's shoulder , my arms round her neck .
It might be two hours later , probably near eleven , when I—not having been able to fall asleep , and deeming , from the perfect silence of the dormitory , that my companions were all wrapt in profound repose—rose softly , put on my frock over my night-dress , and , without shoes , crept from the apartment , and set off in quest of Miss Temple 's room .
Coming near , I found the door slightly ajar ; probably to admit some fresh air into the close abode of sickness .
" Is it her Mr. Bates has been to see ?
" She stirred herself , put back the curtain , and I saw her face , pale , wasted , but quite composed : she looked so little changed that my fear was instantly dissipated .
After a long silence , she resumed , still whispering— " I am very happy , Jane ; and when you hear that I am dead , you must be sure and not grieve : there is nothing to grieve about .
When I awoke it was day : an unusual movement roused me ;
After a long silence , she resumed , still whispering— " I am very happy , Jane ; and when you hear that I am dead , you must be sure and not grieve : there is nothing to grieve about .
" Where is that region ?
I imagined myself only to be regretting my loss , and thinking how to repair it ; but when my reflections were concluded , and I looked up and found that the afternoon was gone , and evening far advanced , another discovery dawned on me , namely , that in the interval I had undergone a transforming process ; that my mind had put off all it had borrowed of Miss Temple—or rather that she had taken with her the serene atmosphere I had been breathing in her vicinity—and that now I was left in my natural element , and beginning to feel the stirring of old emotions .
When I awoke it was day : an unusual movement roused me ;
At this period she married , removed with her husband ( a clergyman , an excellent man , almost worthy of such a wife ) to a distant county , and consequently was lost to me .
I dreaded being discovered and sent back ; for I _ must _ see Helen , —I must embrace her before she died , —I must give her one last kiss , exchange with her one last word .
I looked up ;
" " But where are you going to , Helen ?
" " Yes .
" Why are you come here , Jane ?
" " Yes .
" " Where is God ?
" " I 'll stay with you , _ dear _ Helen : no one shall take me away .
" Again I questioned , but this time only in thought .

" " No , no , Helen !
" " No , no , Helen !
" " But where are you going to , Helen ?
" " And shall I see you again , Helen , when I die ?
I was in somebody 's arms ; the nurse held me ; she was carrying me through the passage back to the dormitory .
I was not reprimanded for leaving my bed ; people had something else to think about ; no explanation was afforded then to my many questions ; but a day or two afterwards I learned that Miss Temple , on returning to her own room at dawn , had found me laid in the little crib ; my face against Helen Burns 's shoulder , my arms round her neck .

I had imbibed from her something of her nature and much of her habits : more harmonious thoughts : what seemed better regulated feelings had become the inmates of my mind .
We all must die one day , and the illness which is removing me is not painful ; it is gentle and gradual : my mind is at rest .
I was asleep , and Helen was—dead .
I traced the white road winding round the base of one mountain , and vanishing in a gorge between two ; how I longed to follow it farther !
I lay with my face hidden on her neck .
Her grave is in Brocklebridge churchyard : for fifteen years after her death it was only covered by a grassy mound ; but now a grey marble tablet marks the spot , inscribed with her name , and the word " Resurgam .

" Can it be you , Jane ?
" she asked , in her own gentle voice .
" Oh !
" I thought , " she is not going to die ; they are mistaken : she could not speak and look so calmly if she were .
" I got on to her crib and kissed her : her forehead was cold , and her cheek both cold and thin , and so were her hand and wrist ; but she smiled as of old .
" Why are you come here , Jane ?
It is past eleven o 'clock : I heard it strike some minutes since .
" " I came to see you , Helen : I heard you were very ill , and I could not sleep till I had spoken to you .
" " You came to bid me good-bye , then : you are just in time probably .
" " Are you going somewhere , Helen ?
Are you going home ?
" " Yes ; to my long home—my last home .
" " No , no , Helen ! " I stopped , distressed . While I tried to devour my tears , a fit of coughing seized Helen ; it did not , however , wake the nurse ; when it was over , she lay some minutes exhausted ; then she whispered— " Jane , your little feet are bare ; lie down and cover yourself with my quilt .
" I did so : she put her arm over me , and I nestled close to her .
After a long silence , she resumed , still whispering— " I am very happy , Jane ; and when you hear that I am dead , you must be sure and not grieve : there is nothing to grieve about .
We all must die one day , and the illness which is removing me is not painful ; it is gentle and gradual : my mind is at rest .
I leave no one to regret me much : I have only a father ; and he is lately married , and will not miss me .
By dying young , I shall escape great sufferings .
I had not qualities or talents to make my way very well in the world : I should have been continually at fault .
" " But where are you going to , Helen ?
Can you see ?
Do you know ?
" " I believe ; I have faith : I am going to God .
" " Where is God ?
What is God ?
" " My Maker and yours , who will never destroy what He created .
I rely implicitly on His power , and confide wholly in His goodness : I count the hours till that eventful one arrives which shall restore me to Him , reveal Him to me .
" " You are sure , then , Helen , that there is such a place as heaven , and that our souls can get to it when we die ?
" " I am sure there is a future state ; I believe God is good ; I can resign my immortal part to Him without any misgiving .
God is my father ;
God is my friend : I love Him ; I believe He loves me .
" " And shall I see you again , Helen , when I die ?
" " You will come to the same region of happiness : be received by the same mighty , universal Parent , no doubt , dear Jane .
" Again I questioned , but this time only in thought . " Where is that region ?
Does it exist ?
" And I clasped my arms closer round Helen ; she seemed dearer to me than ever ; I felt as if I could not let her go ; I lay with my face hidden on her neck .
Presently she said , in the sweetest tone— " How comfortable I am !
That last fit of coughing has tired me a little ; I feel as if I could sleep : but don 't leave me , Jane ; I like to have you near me .
" " I 'll stay with you , _ dear _ Helen : no one shall take me away .
" " Are you warm , darling ?
" " Yes .
" " Good-night , Jane .
" " Good-night , Helen .
" She kissed me , and I her , and we both soon slumbered .
When I awoke it was day : an unusual movement roused me ;
I looked up ; I was in somebody 's arms ; the nurse held me ; she was carrying me through the passage back to the dormitory .
I was not reprimanded for leaving my bed ; people had something else to think about ; no explanation was afforded then to my many questions ; but a day or two afterwards I learned that Miss Temple , on returning to her own room at dawn , had found me laid in the little crib ; my face against Helen Burns 's shoulder , my arms round her neck .
I was asleep , and Helen was—dead .
Her grave is in Brocklebridge churchyard : for fifteen years after her death it was only covered by a grassy mound ; but now a grey marble tablet marks the spot , inscribed with her name , and the word " Resurgam .
Hitherto I have recorded in detail the events of my insignificant existence : to the first ten years of my life I have given almost as many chapters .
But this is not to be a regular autobiography . I am only bound to invoke Memory where I know her responses will possess some degree of interest ; therefore I now pass a space of eight years almost in silence : a few lines only are necessary to keep up the links of connection .
When the typhus fever had fulfilled its mission of devastation at Lowood , it gradually disappeared from thence ; but not till its virulence and the number of its victims had drawn public attention on the school .
Inquiry was made into the origin of the scourge , and by degrees various facts came out which excited public indignation in a high degree .
The unhealthy nature of the site ; the quantity and quality of the children 's food ; the brackish , fetid water used in its preparation ; the pupils ' wretched clothing and accommodations—all these things were discovered , and the discovery produced a result mortifying to Mr. Brocklehurst , but beneficial to the institution .
Several wealthy and benevolent individuals in the county subscribed largely for the erection of a more convenient building in a better situation ; new regulations were made ; improvements in diet and clothing introduced ; the funds of the school were intrusted to the management of a committee .
Mr. Brocklehurst , who , from his wealth and family connections , could not be overlooked , still retained the post of treasurer ; but he was aided in the discharge of his duties by gentlemen of rather more enlarged and sympathising minds : his office of inspector , too , was shared by those who knew how to combine reason with strictness , comfort with economy , compassion with uprightness .
The school , thus improved , became in time a truly useful and noble institution .
I remained an inmate of its walls , after its regeneration , for eight years : six as pupil , and two as teacher ; and in both capacities I bear my testimony to its value and importance .
During these eight years my life was uniform : but not unhappy , because it was not inactive .
I had the means of an excellent education placed within my reach ; a fondness for some of my studies , and a desire to excel in all , together with a great delight in pleasing my teachers , especially such as I loved , urged me on : I availed myself fully of the advantages offered me .
In time I rose to be the first girl of the first class ; then I was invested with the office of teacher ; which I discharged with zeal for two years : but at the end of that time I altered .
Miss Temple , through all changes , had thus far continued superintendent of the seminary : to her instruction I owed the best part of my acquirements ; her friendship and society had been my continual solace ; she had stood me in the stead of mother , governess , and , latterly , companion .
At this period she married , removed with her husband ( a clergyman , an excellent man , almost worthy of such a wife ) to a distant county , and consequently was lost to me .
From the day she left I was no longer the same : with her was gone every settled feeling , every association that had made Lowood in some degree a home to me .
I had imbibed from her something of her nature and much of her habits : more harmonious thoughts : what seemed better regulated feelings had become the inmates of my mind .
I had given in allegiance to duty and order ; I was quiet ; I believed I was content : to the eyes of others , usually even to my own , I appeared a disciplined and subdued character .
But destiny , in the shape of the Rev.
Mr. Nasmyth , came between me and Miss Temple : I saw her in her travelling dress step into a post-chaise , shortly after the marriage ceremony ;
I watched the chaise mount the hill and disappear beyond its brow ; and then retired to my own room , and there spent in solitude the greatest part of the half-holiday granted in honour of the occasion .
I walked about the chamber most of the time .
I imagined myself only to be regretting my loss , and thinking how to repair it ; but when my reflections were concluded , and I looked up and found that the afternoon was gone , and evening far advanced , another discovery dawned on me , namely , that in the interval I had undergone a transforming process ; that my mind had put off all it had borrowed of Miss Temple—or rather that she had taken with her the serene atmosphere I had been breathing in her vicinity—and that now I was left in my natural element , and beginning to feel the stirring of old emotions .
It did not seem as if a prop were withdrawn , but rather as if a motive were gone : it was not the power to be tranquil which had failed me , but the reason for tranquillity was no more .
My world had for some years been in Lowood : my experience had been of its rules and systems ; now I remembered that the real world was wide , and that a varied field of hopes and fears , of sensations and excitements , awaited those who had courage to go forth into its expanse , to seek real knowledge of life amidst its perils .
I went to my window , opened it , and looked out .
There were the two wings of the building ; there was the garden ; there were the skirts of Lowood ; there was the hilly horizon .
My eye passed all other objects to rest on those most remote , the blue peaks ; it was those I longed to surmount ; all within their boundary of rock and heath seemed prison-ground , exile limits .
I traced the white road winding round the base of one mountain , and vanishing in a gorge between two ; how I longed to follow it farther !
I recalled the time when I had travelled that very road in a coach ;
I remembered descending that hill at twilight ; an age seemed to have elapsed since the day which brought me first to Lowood , and I had never quitted it since .
My vacations had all been spent at school : Mrs. Reed had never sent for me to Gateshead ; neither she nor any of her family had ever been to visit me .
I had had no communication by letter or message with the outer world : school-rules , school-duties , school-habits and notions , and voices , and faces , and phrases , and costumes , and preferences , and antipathies—such was what I knew of existence .
And now I felt that it was not enough ;
I tired of the routine of eight years in one afternoon .
I desired liberty ; for liberty I gasped ; for liberty I uttered a prayer ; it seemed scattered on the wind then faintly blowing .
I abandoned it and framed a humbler supplication ; for change , stimulus : that petition , too , seemed swept off into vague space : " Then , " I cried , half desperate , " grant me at least a new servitude !
" Here a bell , ringing the hour of supper , called me downstairs .
I was not free to resume the interrupted chain of my reflections till bedtime : even then a teacher who occupied the same room with me kept me from the subject to which I longed to recur , by a prolonged effusion of small talk .
How I wished sleep would silence her .
It seemed as if , could I but go back to the idea which had last entered my mind as I stood at the window , some inventive suggestion would rise for my relief .
Miss Gryce snored at last ; she was a heavy Welshwoman , and till now her habitual nasal strains had never been regarded by me in any other light than as a nuisance ; to-night I hailed the first deep notes with satisfaction ; I was debarrassed of interruption ; my half-effaced thought instantly revived .
" A new servitude !
There is something in that , " I soliloquised ( mentally , be it understood ;
I did not talk aloud ) , " I know there is , because it does not sound too sweet ; it is not like such words as Liberty , Excitement , Enjoyment : delightful sounds truly ; but no more than sounds for me ; and so hollow and fleeting that it is mere waste of time to listen to them .
But Servitude !
That must be matter of fact .
Any one may serve : I have served here eight years ; now all I want is to serve elsewhere .
Can I not get so much of my own will ?
Is not the thing feasible ?
Yes—yes—the end is not so difficult ; if I had only a brain active enough to ferret out the means of attaining it .
" I sat up in bed by way of arousing this said brain : it was a chilly night ; I covered my shoulders with a shawl , and then I proceeded _ to think _ again with all my might .
" What do I want ?
A new place , in a new house , amongst new faces , under new circumstances : I want this because it is of no use wanting anything better .
How do people do to get a new place ?
They apply to friends , I suppose : I have no friends .
There are many others who have no friends , who must look about for themselves and be their own helpers ; and what is their resource ?
" I could not tell : nothing answered me ;
I then ordered my brain to find a response , and quickly .
It worked and worked faster : I felt the pulses throb in my head and temples ; but for nearly an hour it worked in chaos ; and no result came of its efforts .
Feverish with vain labour , I got up and took a turn in the room ; undrew the curtain , noted a star or two , shivered with cold , and again crept to bed .
A kind fairy , in my absence , had surely dropped the required suggestion on my pillow ; for as I lay down , it came quietly and naturally to my mind.— " Those who want situations advertise ; you must advertise in the _ —shire Herald _ .
" " How ?
I know nothing about advertising .
" Replies rose smooth and prompt now : — " You must enclose the advertisement and the money to pay for it under a cover directed to the editor of the _ Herald _ ; you must put it , the first opportunity you have , into the post at Lowton ; answers must be addressed to J.E. , at the post-office there ; you can go and inquire in about a week after you send your letter , if any are come , and act accordingly .
" This scheme I went over twice , thrice ; it was then digested in my mind ;
I had it in a clear practical form : I felt satisfied , and fell asleep .
With earliest day , I was up : I had my advertisement written , enclosed , and directed before the bell rang to rouse the school ; it ran thus : — " A young lady accustomed to tuition " ( had I not been a teacher two years ? )
" is desirous of meeting with a situation in a private family where the children are under fourteen ( I thought that as I was barely eighteen , it would not do to undertake the guidance of pupils nearer my own age ) .
She is qualified to teach the usual branches of a good English education , together with French , Drawing , and Music " ( in those days , reader , this now narrow catalogue of accomplishments , would have been held tolerably comprehensive ) .
" Address , J.E. , Post-office , Lowton , — shire .
" This document remained locked in my drawer all day : after tea , I asked leave of the new superintendent to go to Lowton , in order to perform some small commissions for myself and one or two of my fellow-teachers ; permission was readily granted ;
I went .
It was a walk of two miles , and the evening was wet , but the days were still long ;
I visited a shop or two , slipped the letter into the post-office , and came back through heavy rain , with streaming garments , but with a relieved heart .
The succeeding week seemed long : it came to an end at last , however , like all sublunary things , and once more , towards the close of a pleasant autumn day , I found myself afoot on the road to Lowton .
A picturesque track it was , by the way ; lying along the side of the beck and through the sweetest curves of the dale : but that day I thought more of the letters , that might or might not be awaiting me at the little burgh whither I was bound , than of the charms of lea and water .
My ostensible errand on this occasion was to get measured for a pair of shoes ; so I discharged that business first , and when it was done , I stepped across the clean and quiet little street from the shoemaker 's to the post-office : it was kept by an old dame , who wore horn spectacles on her nose , and black mittens on her hands .
" Are there any letters for J.E. ?
" I asked .
She peered at me over her spectacles , and then she opened a drawer and fumbled among its contents for a long time , so long that my hopes began to falter .
At last , having held a document before her glasses for nearly five minutes , she presented it across the counter , accompanying the act by another inquisitive and mistrustful glance—it was for J.E. " Is there only one ?
" I demanded .
" There are no more , " said she ; and I put it in my pocket and turned my face homeward : I could not open it then ; rules obliged me to be back by eight , and it was already half-past seven .
Various duties awaited me on my arrival .
I had to sit with the girls during their hour of study ; then it was my turn to read prayers ; to see them to bed : afterwards I supped with the other teachers .
Even when we finally retired for the night , the inevitable Miss Gryce was still my companion : we had only a short end of candle in our candlestick , and I dreaded lest she should talk till it was all burnt out ; fortunately , however , the heavy supper she had eaten produced a soporific effect : she was already snoring before I had finished undressing .
There still remained an inch of candle : I now took out my letter ; the seal was an initial F. ;
I broke it ; the contents were brief .
" If J.E. , who advertised in the _ —shire Herald _ of last Thursday , possesses the acquirements mentioned , and if she is in a position to give satisfactory references as to character and competency , a situation can be offered her where there is but one pupil , a little girl , under ten years of age ; and where the salary is thirty pounds per annum .
J.E. is requested to send references , name , address , and all particulars to the direction : — " Mrs. Fairfax , Thornfield , near Millcote , —shire .
" I examined the document long : the writing was old-fashioned and rather uncertain , like that of an elderly lady .
This circumstance was satisfactory : a private fear had haunted me , that in thus acting for myself , and by my own guidance , I ran the risk of getting into some scrape ; and , above all things , I wished the result of my endeavours to be respectable , proper , _ en regle _ .
" I examined the document long : the writing was old-fashioned and rather uncertain , like that of an elderly lady .
This testimonial I accordingly received in about a month , forwarded a copy of it to Mrs. Fairfax , and got that lady 's reply , stating that she was satisfied , and fixing that day fortnight as the period for my assuming the post of governess in her house .
I saw her in a black gown and widow 's cap ; frigid , perhaps , but not uncivil : a model of elderly English respectability .
Not that my fancy was much captivated by the idea of long chimneys and clouds of smoke— " but , " I argued , " Thornfield will , probably , be a good way from the town .

" There was one in the room ;
We parted finally at the door of the Brocklehurst Arms there : each went her separate way ; she set off for the brow of Lowood Fell to meet the conveyance which was to take her back to Gateshead , I mounted the vehicle which was to bear me to new duties and a new life in the unknown environs of Millcote .
I looked anxiously round as I descended the wooden steps the " boots " placed for my convenience , expecting to hear my name pronounced , and to see some description of carriage waiting to convey me to Thornfield .
" I could not tell : nothing answered me ;
A phase of my life was closing to-night , a new one opening to-morrow : impossible to slumber in the interval ;

" said she exultingly .
The next day she laid the affair before Mr. Brocklehurst , who said that Mrs. Reed must be written to , as she was my natural guardian .

He went to college , and he got—plucked , I think they call it : and then his uncles wanted him to be a barrister , and study the law : but he is such a dissipated young man , they will never make much of him , I think .
" Yes , that is it—that is the very word .
" " And Mrs. Reed ?
" said she exultingly .
" In another second I was embracing and kissing her rapturously : " Bessie !
" " And Mrs. Reed ?
" " Oh , he is not doing so well as his mama could wish .
He went to college , and he got—plucked , I think they call it : and then his uncles wanted him to be a barrister , and study the law : but he is such a dissipated young man , they will never make much of him , I think .
" " What does he look like ?
" " He is very tall : some people call him a fine-looking young man ; but he has such thick lips .
" " And Mrs. Reed ?
" " Missis looks stout and well enough in the face , but I think she 's not quite easy in her mind : Mr. John 's conduct does not please her—he spends a deal of money .
" " Did she send you here , Bessie ?
" " No , indeed : but I have long wanted to see you , and when I heard that there had been a letter from you , and that you were going to another part of the country , I thought I 'd just set off , and get a look at you before you were quite out of my reach .
" " I am afraid you are disappointed in me , Bessie .
" I said this laughing : I perceived that Bessie 's glance , though it expressed regard , did in no shape denote admiration .
" No , Miss Jane , not exactly : you are genteel enough ; you look like a lady , and it is as much as ever I expected of you : you were no beauty as a child .
" I smiled at Bessie 's frank answer : I felt that it was correct , but I confess I was not quite indifferent to its import : at eighteen most people wish to please , and the conviction that they have not an exterior likely to second that desire brings anything but gratification .
" I dare say you are clever , though , " continued Bessie , by way of solace .
" What can you do ?
Can you play on the piano ?
" " A little .
" There was one in the room ;
Bessie went and opened it , and then asked me to sit down and give her a tune : I played a waltz or two , and she was charmed .
" The Miss Reeds could not play as well !
" said she exultingly .
" I always said you would surpass them in learning : and can you draw ?
" " That is one of my paintings over the chimney-piece .
" It was a landscape in water colours , of which I had made a present to the superintendent , in acknowledgment of her obliging mediation with the committee on my behalf , and which she had framed and glazed .
" Well , that is beautiful , Miss Jane !
It is as fine a picture as any Miss Reed 's drawing-master could paint , let alone the young ladies themselves , who could not come near it : and have you learnt French ?
" " Yes , Bessie , I can both read it and speak it .
" " And you can work on muslin and canvas ?
" " I can .
" " Oh , you are quite a lady , Miss Jane !
I knew you would be : you will get on whether your relations notice you or not .
There was something I wanted to ask you .
Have you ever heard anything from your father 's kinsfolk , the Eyres ?
" " Never in my life .
" " Well , you know Missis always said they were poor and quite despicable : and they may be poor ; but I believe they are as much gentry as the Reeds are ; for one day , nearly seven years ago , a Mr. Eyre came to Gateshead and wanted to see you ;
Missis said you were at school fifty miles off ; he seemed so much disappointed , for he could not stay : he was going on a voyage to a foreign country , and the ship was to sail from London in a day or two .
He looked quite a gentleman , and I believe he was your father 's brother .
" " What foreign country was he going to , Bessie ?
" " An island thousands of miles off , where they make wine—the butler did tell me— " " Madeira ?
" I suggested .
" Yes , that is it—that is the very word .
" " So he went ?
" " Yes ; he did not stay many minutes in the house : Missis was very high with him ; she called him afterwards a ' sneaking tradesman .
' My Robert believes he was a wine-merchant .
" " Very likely , " I returned ;
" or perhaps clerk or agent to a wine-merchant .
" Bessie and I conversed about old times an hour longer , and then she was obliged to leave me : I saw her again for a few minutes the next morning at Lowton , while I was waiting for the coach .
We parted finally at the door of the Brocklehurst Arms there : each went her separate way ; she set off for the brow of Lowood Fell to meet the conveyance which was to take her back to Gateshead , I mounted the vehicle which was to bear me to new duties and a new life in the unknown environs of Millcote .
A new chapter in a novel is something like a new scene in a play ; and when I draw up the curtain this time , reader , you must fancy you see a room in the George Inn at Millcote , with such large figured papering on the walls as inn rooms have ; such a carpet , such furniture , such ornaments on the mantelpiece , such prints , including a portrait of George the Third , and another of the Prince of Wales , and a representation of the death of Wolfe .
All this is visible to you by the light of an oil lamp hanging from the ceiling , and by that of an excellent fire , near which I sit in my cloak and bonnet ; my muff and umbrella lie on the table , and I am warming away the numbness and chill contracted by sixteen hours ' exposure to the rawness of an October day : I left Lowton at four o 'clock a.m. , and the Millcote town clock is now just striking eight .
Reader , though I look comfortably accommodated , I am not very tranquil in my mind .
I thought when the coach stopped here there would be some one to meet me ;
I looked anxiously round as I descended the wooden steps the " boots " placed for my convenience , expecting to hear my name pronounced , and to see some description of carriage waiting to convey me to Thornfield .
Nothing of the sort was visible ; and when I asked a waiter if any one had been to inquire after a Miss Eyre , I was answered in the negative : so I had no resource but to request to be shown into a private room : and here I am waiting , while all sorts of doubts and fears are troubling my thoughts .
It is a very strange sensation to inexperienced youth to feel itself quite alone in the world , cut adrift from every connection , uncertain whether the port to which it is bound can be reached , and prevented by many impediments from returning to that it has quitted .
The charm of adventure sweetens that sensation , the glow of pride warms it ; but then the throb of fear disturbs it ; and fear with me became predominant when half-an-hour elapsed and still I was alone .
I bethought myself to ring the bell .
" Is there a place in this neighbourhood called Thornfield ?
" I asked of the waiter who answered the summons .
" Thornfield ?
I don 't know , ma 'am ; I 'll inquire at the bar .
" He vanished , but reappeared instantly— " Is your name Eyre , Miss ?
" " Yes .
" " Person here waiting for you .
" I jumped up , took my muff and umbrella , and hastened into the inn-passage : a man was standing by the open door , and in the lamp-lit street I dimly saw a one-horse conveyance .
" This will be your luggage , I suppose ?
" said the man rather abruptly when he saw me , pointing to my trunk in the passage .
" Yes .
" He hoisted it on to the vehicle , which was a sort of car , and then I got in ; before he shut me up , I asked him how far it was to Thornfield .
" A matter of six miles .
" " How long shall we be before we get there ?
" " Happen an hour and a half .
" He fastened the car door , climbed to his own seat outside , and we set off .
Our progress was leisurely , and gave me ample time to reflect ;
I was content to be at length so near the end of my journey ; and as I leaned back in the comfortable though not elegant conveyance , I meditated much at my ease .
" I suppose , " thought I , " judging from the plainness of the servant and carriage , Mrs. Fairfax is not a very dashing person : so much the better ;
I never lived amongst fine people but once , and I was very miserable with them .
I wonder if she lives alone except this little girl ; if so , and if she is in any degree amiable , I shall surely be able to get on with her ;
I will do my best ; it is a pity that doing one 's best does not always answer .
At Lowood , indeed , I took that resolution , kept it , and succeeded in pleasing ; but with Mrs. Reed , I remember my best was always spurned with scorn .
I pray God Mrs. Fairfax may not turn out a second Mrs. Reed ; but if she does , I am not bound to stay with her ! let the worst come to the worst , I can advertise again .
How far are we on our road now , I wonder ?
" I let down the window and looked out ;
Millcote was behind us ; judging by the number of its lights , it seemed a place of considerable magnitude , much larger than Lowton .
We were now , as far as I could see , on a sort of common ; but there were houses scattered all over the district ; I felt we were in a different region to Lowood , more populous , less picturesque ; more stirring , less romantic .
The roads were heavy , the night misty ; my conductor let his horse walk all the way , and the hour and a half extended , I verily believe , to two hours ; at last he turned in his seat and said— " You 're noan so far fro ' Thornfield now .
" Again I looked out : we were passing a church ;
I saw its low broad tower against the sky , and its bell was tolling a quarter ; I saw a narrow galaxy of lights too , on a hillside , marking a village or hamlet .
About ten minutes after , the driver got down and opened a pair of gates : we passed through , and they clashed to behind us .
We now slowly ascended a drive , and came upon the long front of a house : candlelight gleamed from one curtained bow-window ; all the rest were dark .
The car stopped at the front door ; it was opened by a maid-servant ;
I alighted and went in .
" Will you walk this way , ma 'am ?
" said the girl ; and I followed her across a square hall with high doors all round : she ushered me into a room whose double illumination of fire and candle at first dazzled me , contrasting as it did with the darkness to which my eyes had been for two hours inured ; when I could see , however , a cosy and agreeable picture presented itself to my view .
A snug small room ; a round table by a cheerful fire ; an arm-chair high- backed and old-fashioned , wherein sat the neatest imaginable little elderly lady , in widow 's cap , black silk gown , and snowy muslin apron ; exactly like what I had fancied Mrs. Fairfax , only less stately and milder looking .
She was occupied in knitting ; a large cat sat demurely at her feet ; nothing in short was wanting to complete the beau-ideal of domestic comfort .
A more reassuring introduction for a new governess could scarcely be conceived ; there was no grandeur to overwhelm , no stateliness to embarrass ; and then , as I entered , the old lady got up and promptly and kindly came forward to meet me .
" How do you do , my dear ?
I am afraid you have had a tedious ride ;
John drives so slowly ; you must be cold , come to the fire .
" " Mrs. Fairfax , I suppose ?
" she asked .
" Who is he ?
Mr. Rochester lay down on a sofa in a pretty room called the salon , and Sophie and I had little beds in another place .
" She conducted me to her own chair , and then began to remove my shawl and untie my bonnet-strings ;
I told her I liked it very much .
" " No , —I have no family .
I 'm sure last winter ( it was a very severe one , if you recollect , and when it did not snow , it rained and blew ) , not a creature but the butcher and postman came to the house , from November till February ; and I really got quite melancholy with sitting night after night alone ;
" She returned ; with her own hands cleared her knitting apparatus and a book or two from the table , to make room for the tray which Leah now brought , and then herself handed me the refreshments .
" She conducted me to her own chair , and then began to remove my shawl and untie my bonnet-strings ;
" She approached .
" What did you say , my dear ?
" Good morning , Miss Adela , " said Mrs. Fairfax .
" " I 'll see it carried into your room , " she said , and bustled out .
" I suppose , " thought I , " judging from the plainness of the servant and carriage , Mrs. Fairfax is not a very dashing person : so much the better ;

However , when I had brushed my hair very smooth , and put on my black frock—which , Quakerlike as it was , at least had the merit of fitting to a nicety—and adjusted my clean white tucker , I thought I should do respectably enough to appear before Mrs. Fairfax , and that my new pupil would not at least recoil from me with antipathy .
" Good morning , Miss Adela , " said Mrs. Fairfax .
" she asked .
" What ! out already ?
" My heart really warmed to the worthy lady as I heard her talk ; and I drew my chair a little nearer to her , and expressed my sincere wish that she might find my company as agreeable as she anticipated .
I repeated the question more distinctly .
" How do you like Thornfield ?
" C 'est la ma gouverante !
" " And the little girl—my pupil !
" " To me ?
" " And the little girl—my pupil !
" " To me ?
I am only the housekeeper—the manager .
" Of course I did not—I had never heard of him before ; but the old lady seemed to regard his existence as a universally understood fact , with which everybody must be acquainted by instinct .

A little hamlet , whose roofs were blent with trees , straggled up the side of one of these hills ; the church of the district stood nearer Thornfield : its old tower-top looked over a knoll between the house and gates .
" I suppose , " thought I , " judging from the plainness of the servant and carriage , Mrs. Fairfax is not a very dashing person : so much the better ;

" " Are they foreigners ?
" " I 'll see it carried into your room , " she said , and bustled out .
I 've had the room next to mine prepared for you ; it is only a small apartment , but I thought you would like it better than one of the large front chambers : to be sure they have finer furniture , but they are so dreary and solitary , I never sleep in them myself .
" My heart really warmed to the worthy lady as I heard her talk ; and I drew my chair a little nearer to her , and expressed my sincere wish that she might find my company as agreeable as she anticipated .

A very chill and vault-like air pervaded the stairs and gallery , suggesting cheerless ideas of space and solitude ; and I was glad , when finally ushered into my chamber , to find it of small dimensions , and furnished in ordinary , modern style .
When Mrs. Fairfax had bidden me a kind good-night , and I had fastened my door , gazed leisurely round , and in some measure effaced the eerie impression made by that wide hall , that dark and spacious staircase , and that long , cold gallery , by the livelier aspect of my little room , I remembered that , after a day of bodily fatigue and mental anxiety , I was now at last in safe haven .

I was content to be at length so near the end of my journey ; and as I leaned back in the comfortable though not elegant conveyance , I meditated much at my ease .
It was a fine autumn morning ; the early sun shone serenely on embrowned groves and still green fields ; advancing on to the lawn , I looked up and surveyed the front of the mansion .

It would be difficult to say : I could not then distinctly say it to myself ; yet I had a reason , and a logical , natural reason too .
" I exclaimed .
I dressed myself with care : obliged to be plain—for I had no article of attire that was not made with extreme simplicity—I was still by nature solicitous to be neat .

I dressed myself with care : obliged to be plain—for I had no article of attire that was not made with extreme simplicity—I was still by nature solicitous to be neat .
I sometimes regretted that I was not handsomer ;
I sometimes wished to have rosy cheeks , a straight nose , and small cherry mouth ; I desired to be tall , stately , and finely developed in figure ; I felt it a misfortune that I was so little , so pale , and had features so irregular and so marked .
And why had I these aspirations and these regrets ?
It would be difficult to say : I could not then distinctly say it to myself ; yet I had a reason , and a logical , natural reason too .
However , when I had brushed my hair very smooth , and put on my black frock—which , Quakerlike as it was , at least had the merit of fitting to a nicety—and adjusted my clean white tucker , I thought I should do respectably enough to appear before Mrs. Fairfax , and that my new pupil would not at least recoil from me with antipathy .
Having opened my chamber window , and seen that I left all things straight and neat on the toilet table , I ventured forth .
Traversing the long and matted gallery , I descended the slippery steps of oak ; then I gained the hall : I halted there a minute ;
I looked at some pictures on the walls ( one , I remember , represented a grim man in a cuirass , and one a lady with powdered hair and a pearl necklace ) , at a bronze lamp pendent from the ceiling , at a great clock whose case was of oak curiously carved , and ebon black with time and rubbing .
Everything appeared very stately and imposing to me ; but then I was so little accustomed to grandeur .
The hall-door , which was half of glass , stood open ; I stepped over the threshold .
It was a fine autumn morning ; the early sun shone serenely on embrowned groves and still green fields ; advancing on to the lawn , I looked up and surveyed the front of the mansion .
It was three storeys high , of proportions not vast , though considerable : a gentleman 's manor-house , not a nobleman 's seat : battlements round the top gave it a picturesque look .
Its grey front stood out well from the background of a rookery , whose cawing tenants were now on the wing : they flew over the lawn and grounds to alight in a great meadow , from which these were separated by a sunk fence , and where an array of mighty old thorn trees , strong , knotty , and broad as oaks , at once explained the etymology of the mansion 's designation .
Farther off were hills : not so lofty as those round Lowood , nor so craggy , nor so like barriers of separation from the living world ; but yet quiet and lonely hills enough , and seeming to embrace Thornfield with a seclusion I had not expected to find existent so near the stirring locality of Millcote .
A little hamlet , whose roofs were blent with trees , straggled up the side of one of these hills ; the church of the district stood nearer Thornfield : its old tower-top looked over a knoll between the house and gates .
I was yet enjoying the calm prospect and pleasant fresh air , yet listening with delight to the cawing of the rooks , yet surveying the wide , hoary front of the hall , and thinking what a great place it was for one lonely little dame like Mrs. Fairfax to inhabit , when that lady appeared at the door .
" What ! out already ?
" said she .
" I see you are an early riser .
" I went up to her , and was received with an affable kiss and shake of the hand .
" How do you like Thornfield ?
" she asked .
I told her I liked it very much .
" Yes , " she said , " it is a pretty place ; but I fear it will be getting out of order , unless Mr. Rochester should take it into his head to come and reside here permanently ; or , at least , visit it rather oftener : great houses and fine grounds require the presence of the proprietor .
" " Mr. Rochester !
" I exclaimed .
" Who is he ?
" " The owner of Thornfield , " she responded quietly .
" Did you not know he was called Rochester ?
" Of course I did not—I had never heard of him before ; but the old lady seemed to regard his existence as a universally understood fact , with which everybody must be acquainted by instinct .
" I thought , " I continued , " Thornfield belonged to you .
" " To me ?
Bless you , child ; what an idea !
To me !
I am only the housekeeper—the manager .
To be sure I am distantly related to the Rochesters by the mother 's side , or at least my husband was ; he was a clergyman , incumbent of Hay—that little village yonder on the hill—and that church near the gates was his .
The present Mr. Rochester 's mother was a Fairfax , and second cousin to my husband : but I never presume on the connection—in fact , it is nothing to me ; I consider myself quite in the light of an ordinary housekeeper : my employer is always civil , and I expect nothing more .
" " And the little girl—my pupil !
" " She is Mr. Rochester 's ward ; he commissioned me to find a governess for her .
He intended to have her brought up in —shire , I believe .
Here she comes , with her ' bonne , ' as she calls her nurse .
" The enigma then was explained : this affable and kind little widow was no great dame ; but a dependant like myself .
I did not like her the worse for that ; on the contrary , I felt better pleased than ever .
The equality between her and me was real ; not the mere result of condescension on her part : so much the better—my position was all the freer .
As I was meditating on this discovery , a little girl , followed by her attendant , came running up the lawn .
I looked at my pupil , who did not at first appear to notice me : she was quite a child , perhaps seven or eight years old , slightly built , with a pale , small-featured face , and a redundancy of hair falling in curls to her waist .
" Good morning , Miss Adela , " said Mrs. Fairfax .
" Come and speak to the lady who is to teach you , and to make you a clever woman some day .
" She approached .
" C 'est la ma gouverante !
" said she , pointing to me , and addressing her nurse ; who answered— " Mais oui , certainement .
" " Are they foreigners ?
" I inquired , amazed at hearing the French language .
" The nurse is a foreigner , and Adela was born on the Continent ; and , I believe , never left it till within six months ago .
When she first came here she could speak no English ; now she can make shift to talk it a little : I don 't understand her , she mixes it so with French ; but you will make out her meaning very well , I dare say .
" Fortunately I had had the advantage of being taught French by a French lady ; and as I had always made a point of conversing with Madame Pierrot as often as I could , and had besides , during the last seven years , learnt a portion of French by heart daily—applying myself to take pains with my accent , and imitating as closely as possible the pronunciation of my teacher , I had acquired a certain degree of readiness and correctness in the language , and was not likely to be much at a loss with Mademoiselle Adela .
She came and shook hand with me when she heard that I was her governess ; and as I led her in to breakfast , I addressed some phrases to her in her own tongue : she replied briefly at first , but after we were seated at the table , and she had examined me some ten minutes with her large hazel eyes , she suddenly commenced chattering fluently .
" Ah ! " cried she , in French , " you speak my language as well as Mr. Rochester does : I can talk to you as I can to him , and so can Sophie .
She will be glad : nobody here understands her : Madame Fairfax is all English .
Sophie is my nurse ; she came with me over the sea in a great ship with a chimney that smoked—how it did smoke ! —and I was sick , and so was Sophie , and so was Mr. Rochester .
Mr. Rochester lay down on a sofa in a pretty room called the salon , and Sophie and I had little beds in another place .
I nearly fell out of mine ; it was like a shelf .
And Mademoiselle—what is your name ?
" " Eyre—Jane Eyre .
" " Aire ?
Bah !
I cannot say it .
Well , our ship stopped in the morning , before it was quite daylight , at a great city—a huge city , with very dark houses and all smoky ; not at all like the pretty clean town I came from ; and Mr. Rochester carried me in his arms over a plank to the land , and Sophie came after , and we all got into a coach , which took us to a beautiful large house , larger than this and finer , called an hotel .
We stayed there nearly a week : I and Sophie used to walk every day in a great green place full of trees , called the Park ; and there were many children there besides me , and a pond with beautiful birds in it , that I fed with crumbs .
" " Can you understand her when she runs on so fast ?
" asked Mrs. Fairfax .
I understood her very well , for I had been accustomed to the fluent tongue of Madame Pierrot .
" I wish , " continued the good lady , " you would ask her a question or two about her parents : I wonder if she remembers them ?
" " Adele , " I inquired , " with whom did you live when you were in that pretty clean town you spoke of ?
" " I lived long ago with mama ; but she is gone to the Holy Virgin .
Mama used to teach me to dance and sing , and to say verses .
A great many gentlemen and ladies came to see mama , and I used to dance before them , or to sit on their knees and sing to them : I liked it .
Shall I let you hear me sing now ?
" She had finished her breakfast , so I permitted her to give a specimen of her accomplishments .
Descending from her chair , she came and placed herself on my knee ; then , folding her little hands demurely before her , shaking back her curls and lifting her eyes to the ceiling , she commenced singing a song from some opera .
It was the strain of a forsaken lady , who , after bewailing the perfidy of her lover , calls pride to her aid ; desires her attendant to deck her in her brightest jewels and richest robes , and resolves to meet the false one that night at a ball , and prove to him , by the gaiety of her demeanour , how little his desertion has affected her .
The subject seemed strangely chosen for an infant singer ; but I suppose the point of the exhibition lay in hearing the notes of love and jealousy warbled with the lisp of childhood ; and in very bad taste that point was : at least I thought so .
Adele sang the canzonette tunefully enough , and with the _ naivete _ of her age .
This achieved , she jumped from my knee and said , " Now , Mademoiselle , I will repeat you some poetry .
" Assuming an attitude , she began , " La Ligue des Rats : fable de La Fontaine .
" She then declaimed the little piece with an attention to punctuation and emphasis , a flexibility of voice and an appropriateness of gesture , very unusual indeed at her age , and which proved she had been carefully trained .
" Was it your mama who taught you that piece ?
" I asked .
" Yes , and she just used to say it in this way : ' Qu ' avez vous donc ? lui dit un de ces rats ; parlez !
' She made me lift my hand—so—to remind me to raise my voice at the question .
Now shall I dance for you ?
" " No , that will do : but after your mama went to the Holy Virgin , as you say , with whom did you live then ?
" " With Madame Frederic and her husband : she took care of me , but she is nothing related to me .
I think she is poor , for she had not so fine a house as mama .
I was not long there .
Mr. Rochester asked me if I would like to go and live with him in England , and I said yes ; for I knew Mr. Rochester before I knew Madame Frederic , and he was always kind to me and gave me pretty dresses and toys : but you see he has not kept his word , for he has brought me to England , and now he is gone back again himself , and I never see him .
" After breakfast , Adele and I withdrew to the library , which room , it appears , Mr. Rochester had directed should be used as the schoolroom .
Most of the books were locked up behind glass doors ; but there was one bookcase left open containing everything that could be needed in the way of elementary works , and several volumes of light literature , poetry , biography , travels , a few romances , & c .
I suppose he had considered that these were all the governess would require for her private perusal ; and , indeed , they contented me amply for the present ; compared with the scanty pickings I had now and then been able to glean at Lowood , they seemed to offer an abundant harvest of entertainment and information .
In this room , too , there was a cabinet piano , quite new and of superior tone ; also an easel for painting and a pair of globes .
I found my pupil sufficiently docile , though disinclined to apply : she had not been used to regular occupation of any kind .
I felt it would be injudicious to confine her too much at first ; so , when I had talked to her a great deal , and got her to learn a little , and when the morning had advanced to noon , I allowed her to return to her nurse .
I then proposed to occupy myself till dinner-time in drawing some little sketches for her use .
As I was going upstairs to fetch my portfolio and pencils , Mrs. Fairfax called to me : " Your morning school-hours are over now , I suppose , " said she .
She was in a room the folding-doors of which stood open : I went in when she addressed me .
It was a large , stately apartment , with purple chairs and curtains , a Turkey carpet , walnut-panelled walls , one vast window rich in slanted glass , and a lofty ceiling , nobly moulded .
Mrs. Fairfax was dusting some vases of fine purple spar , which stood on a sideboard .
" What a beautiful room ! " I exclaimed , as I looked round ; for I had never before seen any half so imposing .
" Yes ; this is the dining-room .
I have just opened the window , to let in a little air and sunshine ; for everything gets so damp in apartments that are seldom inhabited ; the drawing-room yonder feels like a vault .
" She pointed to a wide arch corresponding to the window , and hung like it with a Tyrian-dyed curtain , now looped up .
Mounting to it by two broad steps , and looking through , I thought I caught a glimpse of a fairy place , so bright to my novice-eyes appeared the view beyond .
Yet it was merely a very pretty drawing-room , and within it a boudoir , both spread with white carpets , on which seemed laid brilliant garlands of flowers ; both ceiled with snowy mouldings of white grapes and vine-leaves , beneath which glowed in rich contrast crimson couches and ottomans ; while the ornaments on the pale Parian mantelpiece were of sparkling Bohemian glass , ruby red ; and between the windows large mirrors repeated the general blending of snow and fire .
" In what order you keep these rooms , Mrs. Fairfax !
" said I. " No dust , no canvas coverings : except that the air feels chilly , one would think they were inhabited daily .
" " Why , Miss Eyre , though Mr. Rochester 's visits here are rare , they are always sudden and unexpected ; and as I observed that it put him out to find everything swathed up , and to have a bustle of arrangement on his arrival , I thought it best to keep the rooms in readiness .
" " Is Mr. Rochester an exacting , fastidious sort of man ?
" I asked .
" " But has he no peculiarities ?
" " Do you like him ?
Is he liked for himself ?
" I asked .
I felt a conscientious solicitude for Adele 's welfare and progress , and a quiet liking for her little self : just as I cherished towards Mrs. Fairfax a thankfulness for her kindness , and a pleasure in her society proportionate to the tranquil regard she had for me , and the moderation of her mind and character .
Mr. Rochester was Mr. Rochester in her eyes ; a gentleman , a landed proprietor—nothing more : she inquired and searched no further , and evidently wondered at my wish to gain a more definite notion of his identity .
" " Well , but , leaving his land out of the question , do you like him ?
" " Do you like him ?
" " I don 't know—it is not easy to describe—nothing striking , but you feel it when he speaks to you ; you cannot be always sure whether he is in jest or earnest , whether he is pleased or the contrary ; you don 't thoroughly understand him , in short—at least , I don 't : but it is of no consequence , he is a very good master .
" " But has he no peculiarities ?
" " In what way is he peculiar ?
" " But has he no peculiarities ?
I am merely telling the truth .
" not altogether unobjectionable in some points , but she does well enough .
I made some attempts to draw her into conversation , but she seemed a person of few words : a monosyllabic reply usually cut short every effort of that sort .

It was a fine , calm day , though very cold ;
" Mrs. Fairfax !
She had no great talents , no marked traits of character , no peculiar development of feeling or taste which raised her one inch above the ordinary level of childhood ; but neither had she any deficiency or vice which sunk her below it .
Her appearance always acted as a damper to the curiosity raised by her oral oddities : hard-featured and staid , she had no point to which interest could attach .
Sometimes I saw her : she would come out of her room with a basin , or a plate , or a tray in her hand , go down to the kitchen and shortly return , generally ( oh , romantic reader , forgive me for telling the plain truth ! ) bearing a pot of porter .
The large front chambers I thought especially grand : and some of the third-storey rooms , though dark and low , were interesting from their air of antiquity .

" " Do you like him ?
" exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax .
" Was it your mama who taught you that piece ?
I really did not expect any Grace to answer ; for the laugh was as tragic , as preternatural a laugh as any I ever heard ; and , but that it was high noon , and that no circumstance of ghostliness accompanied the curious cachinnation ; but that neither scene nor season favoured fear , I should have been superstitiously afraid .
" I asked .
" " Is Mr. Rochester an exacting , fastidious sort of man ?
" Do the servants sleep in these rooms ?
" Yes ; this is the dining-room .
" Mrs. Fairfax !
" " No , that will do : but after your mama went to the Holy Virgin , as you say , with whom did you live then ?
" Do the servants sleep in these rooms ?
It was a large , stately apartment , with purple chairs and curtains , a Turkey carpet , walnut-panelled walls , one vast window rich in slanted glass , and a lofty ceiling , nobly moulded .
" I called out : for I now heard her descending the great stairs .
I liked the hush , the gloom , the quaintness of these retreats in the day ; but I by no means coveted a night 's repose on one of those wide and heavy beds : shut in , some of them , with doors of oak ; shaded , others , with wrought old English hangings crusted with thick work , portraying effigies of strange flowers , and stranger birds , and strangest human beings , —all which would have looked strange , indeed , by the pallid gleam of moonlight .
Anybody may blame me who likes , when I add further , that , now and then , when I took a walk by myself in the grounds ; when I went down to the gates and looked through them along the road ; or when , while Adele played with her nurse , and Mrs. Fairfax made jellies in the storeroom , I climbed the three staircases , raised the trap-door of the attic , and having reached the leads , looked out afar over sequestered field and hill , and along dim sky-line—that then I longed for a power of vision which might overpass that limit ; which might reach the busy world , towns , regions full of life I had heard of but never seen—that then I desired more of practical experience than I possessed ; more of intercourse with my kind , of acquaintance with variety of character , than was here within my reach .
" Mrs. Fairfax !
The large front chambers I thought especially grand : and some of the third-storey rooms , though dark and low , were interesting from their air of antiquity .
Mounting to it by two broad steps , and looking through , I thought I caught a glimpse of a fairy place , so bright to my novice-eyes appeared the view beyond .
It was a curious laugh ; distinct , formal , mirthless .
I was not long there .
When thus alone , I not unfrequently heard Grace Poole 's laugh : the same peal , the same low , slow ha ! ha ! which , when first heard , had thrilled me : I heard , too , her eccentric murmurs ; stranger than her laugh .
I made some attempts to draw her into conversation , but she seemed a person of few words : a monosyllabic reply usually cut short every effort of that sort .

However , the event showed me I was a fool for entertaining a sense even of surprise .
The door nearest me opened , and a servant came out , —a woman of between thirty and forty ; a set , square-made figure , red-haired , and with a hard , plain face : any apparition less romantic or less ghostly could scarcely be conceived .
" Too much noise , Grace , " said Mrs. Fairfax . " Remember directions !
" Grace curtseyed silently and went in .
" She is a person we have to sew and assist Leah in her housemaid 's work , " continued the widow ; " not altogether unobjectionable in some points , but she does well enough .
By-the-bye , how have you got on with your new pupil this morning ?
" The conversation , thus turned on Adele , continued till we reached the light and cheerful region below .
Adele came running to meet us in the hall , exclaiming— " Mesdames , vous etes servies !
" adding , " J 'ai bien faim , moi !
" We found dinner ready , and waiting for us in Mrs. Fairfax 's room .
The promise of a smooth career , which my first calm introduction to Thornfield Hall seemed to pledge , was not belied on a longer acquaintance with the place and its inmates .
Mrs. Fairfax turned out to be what she appeared , a placid-tempered , kind-natured woman , of competent education and average intelligence .
My pupil was a lively child , who had been spoilt and indulged , and therefore was sometimes wayward ; but as she was committed entirely to my care , and no injudicious interference from any quarter ever thwarted my plans for her improvement , she soon forgot her little freaks , and became obedient and teachable .
She had no great talents , no marked traits of character , no peculiar development of feeling or taste which raised her one inch above the ordinary level of childhood ; but neither had she any deficiency or vice which sunk her below it .
She made reasonable progress , entertained for me a vivacious , though perhaps not very profound , affection ; and by her simplicity , gay prattle , and efforts to please , inspired me , in return , with a degree of attachment sufficient to make us both content in each other 's society .
This , _ par parenthese _ , will be thought cool language by persons who entertain solemn doctrines about the angelic nature of children , and the duty of those charged with their education to conceive for them an idolatrous devotion : but I am not writing to flatter parental egotism , to echo cant , or prop up humbug ; I am merely telling the truth .
I felt a conscientious solicitude for Adele 's welfare and progress , and a quiet liking for her little self : just as I cherished towards Mrs. Fairfax a thankfulness for her kindness , and a pleasure in her society proportionate to the tranquil regard she had for me , and the moderation of her mind and character .
Anybody may blame me who likes , when I add further , that , now and then , when I took a walk by myself in the grounds ; when I went down to the gates and looked through them along the road ; or when , while Adele played with her nurse , and Mrs. Fairfax made jellies in the storeroom , I climbed the three staircases , raised the trap-door of the attic , and having reached the leads , looked out afar over sequestered field and hill , and along dim sky-line—that then I longed for a power of vision which might overpass that limit ; which might reach the busy world , towns , regions full of life I had heard of but never seen—that then I desired more of practical experience than I possessed ; more of intercourse with my kind , of acquaintance with variety of character , than was here within my reach .
I valued what was good in Mrs. Fairfax , and what was good in Adele ; but I believed in the existence of other and more vivid kinds of goodness , and what I believed in I wished to behold .
Who blames me ?
Many , no doubt ; and I shall be called discontented .
I could not help it : the restlessness was in my nature ; it agitated me to pain sometimes .
Then my sole relief was to walk along the corridor of the third storey , backwards and forwards , safe in the silence and solitude of the spot , and allow my mind 's eye to dwell on whatever bright visions rose before it—and , certainly , they were many and glowing ; to let my heart be heaved by the exultant movement , which , while it swelled it in trouble , expanded it with life ; and , best of all , to open my inward ear to a tale that was never ended—a tale my imagination created , and narrated continuously ; quickened with all of incident , life , fire , feeling , that I desired and had not in my actual existence .
It is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with tranquillity : they must have action ; and they will make it if they cannot find it .
Millions are condemned to a stiller doom than mine , and millions are in silent revolt against their lot .
Nobody knows how many rebellions besides political rebellions ferment in the masses of life which people earth .
Women are supposed to be very calm generally : but women feel just as men feel ; they need exercise for their faculties , and a field for their efforts , as much as their brothers do ; they suffer from too rigid a restraint , too absolute a stagnation , precisely as men would suffer ; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings , to playing on the piano and embroidering bags .
It is thoughtless to condemn them , or laugh at them , if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex .
When thus alone , I not unfrequently heard Grace Poole 's laugh : the same peal , the same low , slow ha ! ha ! which , when first heard , had thrilled me : I heard , too , her eccentric murmurs ; stranger than her laugh .
There were days when she was quite silent ; but there were others when I could not account for the sounds she made .
Sometimes I saw her : she would come out of her room with a basin , or a plate , or a tray in her hand , go down to the kitchen and shortly return , generally ( oh , romantic reader , forgive me for telling the plain truth ! ) bearing a pot of porter .
Her appearance always acted as a damper to the curiosity raised by her oral oddities : hard-featured and staid , she had no point to which interest could attach .
I made some attempts to draw her into conversation , but she seemed a person of few words : a monosyllabic reply usually cut short every effort of that sort .
The other members of the household , viz .
, John and his wife , Leah the housemaid , and Sophie the French nurse , were decent people ; but in no respect remarkable ; with Sophie I used to talk French , and sometimes I asked her questions about her native country ; but she was not of a descriptive or narrative turn , and generally gave such vapid and confused answers as were calculated rather to check than encourage inquiry .
October , November , December passed away .
One afternoon in January , Mrs. Fairfax had begged a holiday for Adele , because she had a cold ; and , as Adele seconded the request with an ardour that reminded me how precious occasional holidays had been to me in my own childhood , I accorded it , deeming that I did well in showing pliability on the point .
It was a fine , calm day , though very cold ;
I was tired of sitting still in the library through a whole long morning : Mrs. Fairfax had just written a letter which was waiting to be posted , so I put on my bonnet and cloak and volunteered to carry it to Hay ; the distance , two miles , would be a pleasant winter afternoon walk .
Having seen Adele comfortably seated in her little chair by Mrs. Fairfax 's parlour fireside , and given her her best wax doll ( which I usually kept enveloped in silver paper in a drawer ) to play with , and a story-book for change of amusement ; and having replied to her " Revenez bientot , ma bonne amie , ma chere Mdlle . Jeannette , " with a kiss I set out .
The ground was hard , the air was still , my road was lonely ; I walked fast till I got warm , and then I walked slowly to enjoy and analyse the species of pleasure brooding for me in the hour and situation .
It was three o 'clock ; the church bell tolled as I passed under the belfry : the charm of the hour lay in its approaching dimness , in the low-gliding and pale-beaming sun .
I was a mile from Thornfield , in a lane noted for wild roses in summer , for nuts and blackberries in autumn , and even now possessing a few coral treasures in hips and haws , but whose best winter delight lay in its utter solitude and leafless repose .
If a breath of air stirred , it made no sound here ; for there was not a holly , not an evergreen to rustle , and the stripped hawthorn and hazel bushes were as still as the white , worn stones which causewayed the middle of the path .
Far and wide , on each side , there were only fields , where no cattle now browsed ; and the little brown birds , which stirred occasionally in the hedge , looked like single russet leaves that had forgotten to drop .
This lane inclined up-hill all the way to Hay ; having reached the middle , I sat down on a stile which led thence into a field .
Gathering my mantle about me , and sheltering my hands in my muff , I did not feel the cold , though it froze keenly ; as was attested by a sheet of ice covering the causeway , where a little brooklet , now congealed , had overflowed after a rapid thaw some days since .
From my seat I could look down on Thornfield : the grey and battlemented hall was the principal object in the vale below me ; its woods and dark rookery rose against the west .
I lingered till the sun went down amongst the trees , and sank crimson and clear behind them .
I then turned eastward .
On the hill-top above me sat the rising moon ; pale yet as a cloud , but brightening momentarily , she looked over Hay , which , half lost in trees , sent up a blue smoke from its few chimneys : it was yet a mile distant , but in the absolute hush I could hear plainly its thin murmurs of life .
My ear , too , felt the flow of currents ; in what dales and depths I could not tell : but there were many hills beyond Hay , and doubtless many becks threading their passes .
That evening calm betrayed alike the tinkle of the nearest streams , the sough of the most remote .
A rude noise broke on these fine ripplings and whisperings , at once so far away and so clear : a positive tramp , tramp , a metallic clatter , which effaced the soft wave-wanderings ; as , in a picture , the solid mass of a crag , or the rough boles of a great oak , drawn in dark and strong on the foreground , efface the aerial distance of azure hill , sunny horizon , and blended clouds where tint melts into tint .
The din was on the causeway : a horse was coming ; the windings of the lane yet hid it , but it approached . I was just leaving the stile ; yet , as the path was narrow , I sat still to let it go by .
In those days I was young , and all sorts of fancies bright and dark tenanted my mind : the memories of nursery stories were there amongst other rubbish ; and when they recurred , maturing youth added to them a vigour and vividness beyond what childhood could give .
As this horse approached , and as I watched for it to appear through the dusk , I remembered certain of Bessie 's tales , wherein figured a North-of-England spirit called a " Gytrash , " which , in the form of horse , mule , or large dog , haunted solitary ways , and sometimes came upon belated travellers , as this horse was now coming upon me .
It was very near , but not yet in sight ; when , in addition to the tramp , tramp , I heard a rush under the hedge , and close down by the hazel stems glided a great dog , whose black and white colour made him a distinct object against the trees .
It was exactly one form of Bessie 's Gytrash—a lion-like creature with long hair and a huge head : it passed me , however , quietly enough ; not staying to look up , with strange pretercanine eyes , in my face , as I half expected it would .
The horse followed , —a tall steed , and on its back a rider .
The man , the human being , broke the spell at once .
Nothing ever rode the Gytrash : it was always alone ; and goblins , to my notions , though they might tenant the dumb carcasses of beasts , could scarce covet shelter in the commonplace human form .
No Gytrash was this , —only a traveller taking the short cut to Millcote .
He passed , and I went on ; a few steps , and I turned : a sliding sound and an exclamation of " What the deuce is to do now ? " and a clattering tumble , arrested my attention .
Man and horse were down ; they had slipped on the sheet of ice which glazed the causeway .
The dog came bounding back , and seeing his master in a predicament , and hearing the horse groan , barked till the evening hills echoed the sound , which was deep in proportion to his magnitude .
He snuffed round the prostrate group , and then he ran up to me ; it was all he could do , —there was no other help at hand to summon .
I obeyed him , and walked down to the traveller , by this time struggling himself free of his steed .
His efforts were so vigorous , I thought he could not be much hurt ; but I asked him the question— " Are you injured , sir ?
" I think he was swearing , but am not certain ; however , he was pronouncing some formula which prevented him from replying to me directly .
" Can I do anything ?
" I asked again .
" You must just stand on one side , " he answered as he rose , first to his knees , and then to his feet .
I did ; whereupon began a heaving , stamping , clattering process , accompanied by a barking and baying which removed me effectually some yards ' distance ; but I would not be driven quite away till I saw the event .
This was finally fortunate ; the horse was re-established , and the dog was silenced with a " Down , Pilot !
" The traveller now , stooping , felt his foot and leg , as if trying whether they were sound ; apparently something ailed them , for he halted to the stile whence I had just risen , and sat down .
I was in the mood for being useful , or at least officious , I think , for I now drew near him again .
" If you are hurt , and want help , sir , I can fetch some one either from Thornfield Hall or from Hay .
" " Thank you : I shall do : I have no broken bones , —only a sprain ;
" and again he stood up and tried his foot , but the result extorted an involuntary " Ugh !
" Something of daylight still lingered , and the moon was waxing bright : I could see him plainly .
His figure was enveloped in a riding cloak , fur collared and steel clasped ; its details were not apparent , but I traced the general points of middle height and considerable breadth of chest .
He had a dark face , with stern features and a heavy brow ; his eyes and gathered eyebrows looked ireful and thwarted just now ; he was past youth , but had not reached middle-age ; perhaps he might be thirty-five .
I felt no fear of him , and but little shyness .
Had he been a handsome , heroic- looking young gentleman , I should not have dared to stand thus questioning him against his will , and offering my services unasked .
I had hardly ever seen a handsome youth ; never in my life spoken to one .
I had a theoretical reverence and homage for beauty , elegance , gallantry , fascination ; but had I met those qualities incarnate in masculine shape , I should have known instinctively that they neither had nor could have sympathy with anything in me , and should have shunned them as one would fire , lightning , or anything else that is bright but antipathetic .
If even this stranger had smiled and been good-humoured to me when I addressed him ; if he had put off my offer of assistance gaily and with thanks , I should have gone on my way and not felt any vocation to renew inquiries : but the frown , the roughness of the traveller , set me at my ease : I retained my station when he waved to me to go , and announced— " I cannot think of leaving you , sir , at so late an hour , in this solitary lane , till I see you are fit to mount your horse .
" He looked at me when I said this ; he had hardly turned his eyes in my direction before .
" I should think you ought to be at home yourself , " said he , " if you have a home in this neighbourhood : where do you come from ?
" " From just below ; and I am not at all afraid of being out late when it is moonlight : I will run over to Hay for you with pleasure , if you wish it : indeed , I am going there to post a letter .
" " You live just below—do you mean at that house with the battlements ?
" pointing to Thornfield Hall , on which the moon cast a hoary gleam , bringing it out distinct and pale from the woods that , by contrast with the western sky , now seemed one mass of shadow .
" Yes , sir .
" " Whose house is it ?
" " Mr. Rochester 's .
" " Do you know Mr. Rochester ?
" " No , I have never seen him .
" " He is not resident , then ?
" " No . " " Can you tell me where he is ?
" " I cannot .
" " You are not a servant at the hall , of course .
You are— " He stopped , ran his eye over my dress , which , as usual , was quite simple : a black merino cloak , a black beaver bonnet ; neither of them half fine enough for a lady 's-maid .
He seemed puzzled to decide what I was ;
I helped him .
" I am the governess .
" " Ah , the governess !
" he repeated ;
" deuce take me , if I had not forgotten !
The governess !
" and again my raiment underwent scrutiny .
In two minutes he rose from the stile : his face expressed pain when he tried to move .
" I cannot commission you to fetch help , " he said ;
" but you may help me a little yourself , if you will be so kind .
" " Yes , sir .
" " You have not an umbrella that I can use as a stick ?
" " No . " " Try to get hold of my horse 's bridle and lead him to me : you are not afraid ?
" I should have been afraid to touch a horse when alone , but when told to do it , I was disposed to obey .
I put down my muff on the stile , and went up to the tall steed ;
I endeavoured to catch the bridle , but it was a spirited thing , and would not let me come near its head ;
I made effort on effort , though in vain : meantime , I was mortally afraid of its trampling fore-feet .
The traveller waited and watched for some time , and at last he laughed .
" I see , " he said , " the mountain will never be brought to Mahomet , so all you can do is to aid Mahomet to go to the mountain ; I must beg of you to come here .
" I came .
" Excuse me , " he continued : " necessity compels me to make you useful .
" He laid a heavy hand on my shoulder , and leaning on me with some stress , limped to his horse .
Having once caught the bridle , he mastered it directly and sprang to his saddle ; grimacing grimly as he made the effort , for it wrenched his sprain .
" Now , " said he , releasing his under lip from a hard bite , " just hand me my whip ; it lies there under the hedge .
" I sought it and found it .
" Thank you ; now make haste with the letter to Hay , and return as fast as you can .
" A touch of a spurred heel made his horse first start and rear , and then bound away ; the dog rushed in his traces ; all three vanished , " Like heath that , in the wilderness , The wild wind whirls away .
" I took up my muff and walked on .
I had given it : I was pleased to have done something ; trivial , transitory though the deed was , it was yet an active thing , and I was weary of an existence all passive .
I had given it : I was pleased to have done something ; trivial , transitory though the deed was , it was yet an active thing , and I was weary of an existence all passive .
I recognised his decisive nose , more remarkable for character than beauty ; his full nostrils , denoting , I thought , choler ; his grim mouth , chin , and jaw—yes , all three were very grim , and no mistake .
I saw it as I walked fast down-hill all the way home .
When I came to the stile , I stopped a minute , looked round and listened , with an idea that a horse 's hoofs might ring on the causeway again , and that a rider in a cloak , and a Gytrash-like Newfoundland dog , might be again apparent : I saw only the hedge and a pollard willow before me , rising up still and straight to meet the moonbeams ;
" he repeated ;
" I came .
I did not like re-entering Thornfield .
To pass its threshold was to return to stagnation ; to cross the silent hall , to ascend the darksome staircase , to seek my own lonely little room , and then to meet tranquil Mrs. Fairfax , and spend the long winter evening with her , and her only , was to quell wholly the faint excitement wakened by my walk , —to slip again over my faculties the viewless fetters of an uniform and too still existence ; of an existence whose very privileges of security and ease I was becoming incapable of appreciating .
What good it would have done me at that time to have been tossed in the storms of an uncertain struggling life , and to have been taught by rough and bitter experience to long for the calm amidst which I now repined !

What good it would have done me at that time to have been tossed in the storms of an uncertain struggling life , and to have been taught by rough and bitter experience to long for the calm amidst which I now repined !
I could not see into the interior ; and both my eyes and spirit seemed drawn from the gloomy house—from the grey-hollow filled with rayless cells , as it appeared to me—to that sky expanded before me , —a blue sea absolved from taint of cloud ; the moon ascending it in solemn march ; her orb seeming to look up as she left the hill-tops , from behind which she had come , far and farther below her , and aspired to the zenith , midnight dark in its fathomless depth and measureless distance ; and for those trembling stars that followed her course ; they made my heart tremble , my veins glow when I viewed them .
I paced backwards and forwards on the pavement ; the shutters of the glass door were closed ;
Two wax candles stood lighted on the table , and two on the mantelpiece ; basking in the light and heat of a superb fire , lay Pilot—Adele knelt near him .
Two wax candles stood lighted on the table , and two on the mantelpiece ; basking in the light and heat of a superb fire , lay Pilot—Adele knelt near him .
It revealed , too , a group near the mantelpiece : I had scarcely caught it , and scarcely become aware of a cheerful mingling of voices , amongst which I seemed to distinguish the tones of Adele , when the door closed .
I let Mrs. Fairfax precede me into the dining-room , and kept in her shade as we crossed that apartment ; and , passing the arch , whose curtain was now dropped , entered the elegant recess beyond .
" " Indeed ! and is Mrs. Fairfax with him ?

Besides , the eccentricity of the proceeding was piquant : I felt interested to see how he would go on .

His figure was enveloped in a riding cloak , fur collared and steel clasped ; its details were not apparent , but I traced the general points of middle height and considerable breadth of chest .

" " Whose house is it ?

" " Ah , the governess !
" " He is not resident , then ?
" " Yes , sir .
" I asked again .
Man and horse were down ; they had slipped on the sheet of ice which glazed the causeway .
The horse followed , —a tall steed , and on its back a rider .
Man and horse were down ; they had slipped on the sheet of ice which glazed the causeway .
" Yes , sir .
Bring me a candle will you Leah ?
I must beg of you to come here .
" " Indeed ! and is Mrs. Fairfax with him ?
" " Do you know Mr. Rochester ?
At this moment I am not disposed to accost her .
" I took up my muff and walked on .
" " Do you know Mr. Rochester ?
" he repeated ;
Mrs. Fairfax seemed to think it necessary that some one should be amiable , and she began to talk .
I let Mrs. Fairfax precede me into the dining-room , and kept in her shade as we crossed that apartment ; and , passing the arch , whose curtain was now dropped , entered the elegant recess beyond .
I put down my muff on the stile , and went up to the tall steed ;
I heard only the faintest waft of wind roaming fitful among the trees round Thornfield , a mile distant ; and when I glanced down in the direction of the murmur , my eye , traversing the hall-front , caught a light kindling in a window : it reminded me that I was late , and I hurried on .
" " Whose house is it ?
I did not like re-entering Thornfield .
" I asked again .
At this moment I am not disposed to accost her .
" " Do you know Mr. Rochester ?
To pass its threshold was to return to stagnation ; to cross the silent hall , to ascend the darksome staircase , to seek my own lonely little room , and then to meet tranquil Mrs. Fairfax , and spend the long winter evening with her , and her only , was to quell wholly the faint excitement wakened by my walk , —to slip again over my faculties the viewless fetters of an uniform and too still existence ; of an existence whose very privileges of security and ease I was becoming incapable of appreciating .

As he took the cup from my hand , Adele , thinking the moment propitious for making a request in my favour , cried out— " N 'est-ce pas , monsieur , qu 'il y a un cadeau pour Mademoiselle Eyre dans votre petit coffre ?
His shape , now divested of cloak , I perceived harmonised in squareness with his physiognomy : I suppose it was a good figure in the athletic sense of the term—broad chested and thin flanked , though neither tall nor graceful .
" Yes , sir .
" said Mrs. Fairfax to me ;
" Something of daylight still lingered , and the moon was waxing bright : I could see him plainly .

I paced backwards and forwards on the pavement ; the shutters of the glass door were closed ;
It revealed , too , a group near the mantelpiece : I had scarcely caught it , and scarcely become aware of a cheerful mingling of voices , amongst which I seemed to distinguish the tones of Adele , when the door closed .
" said Mrs. Fairfax to me ;
What good it would have done me at that time to have been tossed in the storms of an uncertain struggling life , and to have been taught by rough and bitter experience to long for the calm amidst which I now repined !
" Mr. Rochester would be glad if you and your pupil would take tea with him in the drawing-room this evening , " said she : " he has been so much engaged all day that he could not ask to see you before .
" " Whose house is it ?
" I asked again .
" Yes , sir .
I lingered at the gates ;
" Mr. Rochester would be glad if you and your pupil would take tea with him in the drawing-room this evening , " said she : " he has been so much engaged all day that he could not ask to see you before .
I helped him .
Bring me a candle will you Leah ?
" Can I do anything ?
" " Yes , sir .
" " Yes , you had better : I always dress for the evening when Mr. Rochester is here .
" This additional ceremony seemed somewhat stately ; however , I repaired to my room , and , with Mrs. Fairfax 's aid , replaced my black stuff dress by one of black silk ; the best and the only additional one I had , except one of light grey , which , in my Lowood notions of the toilette , I thought too fine to be worn , except on first-rate occasions .
" You want a brooch , " said Mrs. Fairfax .
I had a single little pearl ornament which Miss Temple gave me as a parting keepsake : I put it on , and then we went downstairs .
Unused as I was to strangers , it was rather a trial to appear thus formally summoned in Mr. Rochester 's presence .
I let Mrs. Fairfax precede me into the dining-room , and kept in her shade as we crossed that apartment ; and , passing the arch , whose curtain was now dropped , entered the elegant recess beyond .
Two wax candles stood lighted on the table , and two on the mantelpiece ; basking in the light and heat of a superb fire , lay Pilot—Adele knelt near him .
Half reclined on a couch appeared Mr. Rochester , his foot supported by the cushion ; he was looking at Adele and the dog : the fire shone full on his face .
I knew my traveller with his broad and jetty eyebrows ; his square forehead , made squarer by the horizontal sweep of his black hair .
I recognised his decisive nose , more remarkable for character than beauty ; his full nostrils , denoting , I thought , choler ; his grim mouth , chin , and jaw—yes , all three were very grim , and no mistake .
His shape , now divested of cloak , I perceived harmonised in squareness with his physiognomy : I suppose it was a good figure in the athletic sense of the term—broad chested and thin flanked , though neither tall nor graceful .
Mr. Rochester must have been aware of the entrance of Mrs. Fairfax and myself ; but it appeared he was not in the mood to notice us , for he never lifted his head as we approached .
" Here is Miss Eyre , sir , " said Mrs. Fairfax , in her quiet way .
He bowed , still not taking his eyes from the group of the dog and child .
" Let Miss Eyre be seated , " said he : and there was something in the forced stiff bow , in the impatient yet formal tone , which seemed further to express , " What the deuce is it to me whether Miss Eyre be there or not ?
At this moment I am not disposed to accost her .
" I sat down quite disembarrassed .
A reception of finished politeness would probably have confused me : I could not have returned or repaid it by answering grace and elegance on my part ; but harsh caprice laid me under no obligation ; on the contrary , a decent quiescence , under the freak of manner , gave me the advantage .
Besides , the eccentricity of the proceeding was piquant : I felt interested to see how he would go on .
He went on as a statue would , that is , he neither spoke nor moved .
Mrs. Fairfax seemed to think it necessary that some one should be amiable , and she began to talk .
Kindly , as usual—and , as usual , rather trite—she condoled with him on the pressure of business he had had all day ; on the annoyance it must have been to him with that painful sprain : then she commended his patience and perseverance in going through with it .
" Madam , I should like some tea , " was the sole rejoinder she got .
She hastened to ring the bell ; and when the tray came , she proceeded to arrange the cups , spoons , & c . , with assiduous celerity .
I and Adele went to the table ; but the master did not leave his couch .
" Will you hand Mr. Rochester 's cup ?
" said Mrs. Fairfax to me ;
" Adele might perhaps spill it .
" I did as requested .
As he took the cup from my hand , Adele , thinking the moment propitious for making a request in my favour , cried out— " N 'est-ce pas , monsieur , qu 'il y a un cadeau pour Mademoiselle Eyre dans votre petit coffre ?
" " Who talks of cadeaux ?
" said he gruffly .
" Did you expect a present , Miss Eyre ?
Are you fond of presents ?
" and he searched my face with eyes that I saw were dark , irate , and piercing .
" I hardly know , sir ;
I have little experience of them : they are generally thought pleasant things .
" " Generally thought ?
But what do _ you _ think ?
" " I should be obliged to take time , sir , before I could give you an answer worthy of your acceptance : a present has many faces to it , has it not ? and one should consider all , before pronouncing an opinion as to its nature .
" " Miss Eyre , you are not so unsophisticated as Adele : she demands a ' cadeau , ' clamorously , the moment she sees me : you beat about the bush .
" " Because I have less confidence in my deserts than Adele has : she can prefer the claim of old acquaintance , and the right too of custom ; for she says you have always been in the habit of giving her playthings ; but if I had to make out a case I should be puzzled , since I am a stranger , and have done nothing to entitle me to an acknowledgment .
" " Oh , don 't fall back on over-modesty !
I have examined Adele , and find you have taken great pains with her : she is not bright , she has no talents ; yet in a short time she has made much improvement .
" " Sir , you have now given me my ' cadeau ; ' I am obliged to you : it is the meed teachers most covet—praise of their pupils ' progress .
" " Humph !
" said Mr. Rochester , and he took his tea in silence .
" Come to the fire , " said the master , when the tray was taken away , and Mrs. Fairfax had settled into a corner with her knitting ; while Adele was leading me by the hand round the room , showing me the beautiful books and ornaments on the consoles and chiffonnieres .
We obeyed , as in duty bound ;
Adele wanted to take a seat on my knee , but she was ordered to amuse herself with Pilot .
" You have been resident in my house three months ?
" " Yes , sir .
" " And you came from— ?
" " From Lowood school , in —shire .
" " Ah ! a charitable concern .
How long were you there ?
" " Eight years .
" " Eight years ! you must be tenacious of life .
I thought half the time in such a place would have done up any constitution !
No wonder you have rather the look of another world .
I marvelled where you had got that sort of face .
When you came on me in Hay Lane last night , I thought unaccountably of fairy tales , and had half a mind to demand whether you had bewitched my horse : I am not sure yet .
Who are your parents ?
" " I have none .
" " Nor ever had , I suppose : do you remember them ?
" " No . " " I thought not .
And so you were waiting for your people when you sat on that stile ?
" " For whom , sir ?
" " For the men in green : it was a proper moonlight evening for them .
Did I break through one of your rings , that you spread that damned ice on the causeway ?
" I shook my head .
" The men in green all forsook England a hundred years ago , " said I , speaking as seriously as he had done .
" And not even in Hay Lane , or the fields about it , could you find a trace of them .
I don 't think either summer or harvest , or winter moon , will ever shine on their revels more .
" Mrs. Fairfax had dropped her knitting , and , with raised eyebrows , seemed wondering what sort of talk this was .
" Well , " resumed Mr. Rochester , " if you disown parents , you must have some sort of kinsfolk : uncles and aunts ?
" " No ; none that I ever saw .
" " And your home ?
" " I have none .
" " Where do your brothers and sisters live ?
" " I have no brothers or sisters .
" " Who recommended you to come here ?
" " I advertised , and Mrs. Fairfax answered my advertisement .
" " Yes , " said the good lady , who now knew what ground we were upon , " and I am daily thankful for the choice Providence led me to make .
Miss Eyre has been an invaluable companion to me , and a kind and careful teacher to Adele .
" " Don 't trouble yourself to give her a character , " returned Mr. Rochester : " eulogiums will not bias me ;
I shall judge for myself .
She began by felling my horse .
" " Sir ?
" said Mrs. Fairfax .
" I have to thank her for this sprain .
" The widow looked bewildered .
" Miss Eyre , have you ever lived in a town ?
" " No , sir .
" " Have you seen much society ?
" " None but the pupils and teachers of Lowood , and now the inmates of Thornfield .
" " Have you read much ?
" " Only such books as came in my way ; and they have not been numerous or very learned .
" " You have lived the life of a nun : no doubt you are well drilled in religious forms ;
—Brocklehurst , who I understand directs Lowood , is a parson , is he not ?
" " Yes , sir .
" " And you girls probably worshipped him , as a convent full of religieuses would worship their director .
" " Oh , no . " " You are very cool !
No !
What ! a novice not worship her priest !
That sounds blasphemous .
" " I disliked Mr. Brocklehurst ; and I was not alone in the feeling .
He is a harsh man ; at once pompous and meddling ; he cut off our hair ; and for economy 's sake bought us bad needles and thread , with which we could hardly sew .
" " That was very false economy , " remarked Mrs. Fairfax , who now again caught the drift of the dialogue .
" And was that the head and front of his offending ?
" demanded Mr. Rochester .
" He starved us when he had the sole superintendence of the provision department , before the committee was appointed ; and he bored us with long lectures once a week , and with evening readings from books of his own inditing , about sudden deaths and judgments , which made us afraid to go to bed .
" " What age were you when you went to Lowood ?
" " About ten .
" " And you stayed there eight years : you are now , then , eighteen ?
" I assented .
" Arithmetic , you see , is useful ; without its aid , I should hardly have been able to guess your age .
It is a point difficult to fix where the features and countenance are so much at variance as in your case .
And now what did you learn at Lowood ?
Can you play ?
" " A little .
" " A little .
" I did as requested .
" " What age were you when you went to Lowood ?
" I closed the piano and returned .
" I did as requested .
" " Humph !
" said he gruffly .
" You play _ a little _ , I see ; like any other English school-girl ; perhaps rather better than some , but not well .
" I closed the piano and returned .
" " Don 't trouble yourself to give her a character , " returned Mr. Rochester : " eulogiums will not bias me ;
" You play _ a little _ , I see ; like any other English school-girl ; perhaps rather better than some , but not well .
No !
" I shook my head .
" " Ah ! a charitable concern .
Go into the library—I mean , if you please.— ( Excuse my tone of command ;
" " No ; none that I ever saw .
" I hardly know , sir ;
" I closed the piano and returned .
" said Mr. Rochester , and he took his tea in silence .

" You have been resident in my house three months ?
These pictures were in water-colours .
" " Yes , sir .
" " And you came from— ?
" " Nor ever had , I suppose : do you remember them ?
" " I did them in the last two vacations I spent at Lowood , when I had no other occupation .
" " And you came from— ?

" He spread the pictures before him , and again surveyed them alternately .
I have little experience of them : they are generally thought pleasant things .
These pictures were in water-colours .
As I saw them with the spiritual eye , before I attempted to embody them , they were striking ; but my hand would not second my fancy , and in each case it had wrought out but a pale portrait of the thing I had conceived .
These pictures were in water-colours .
The third showed the pinnacle of an iceberg piercing a polar winter sky : a muster of northern lights reared their dim lances , close serried , along the horizon .
" And not even in Hay Lane , or the fields about it , could you find a trace of them .
Beyond and above spread an expanse of sky , dark blue as at twilight : rising into the sky was a woman 's shape to the bust , portrayed in tints as dusk and soft as I could combine .

And now what did you learn at Lowood ?
" He spread the pictures before him , and again surveyed them alternately .
" I closed the piano and returned .
" Miss Eyre , have you ever lived in a town ?
Take her to bed .
" Adele went to kiss him before quitting the room : he endured the caress , but scarcely seemed to relish it more than Pilot would have done , nor so much .
" I wish you all good-night , now , " said he , making a movement of the hand towards the door , in token that he was tired of our company , and wished to dismiss us .
Mrs. Fairfax folded up her knitting : I took my portfolio : we curtseyed to him , received a frigid bow in return , and so withdrew .
" You said Mr. Rochester was not strikingly peculiar , Mrs. Fairfax , " I observed , when I rejoined her in her room , after putting Adele to bed .
" Well , is he ?
" " I think so : he is very changeful and abrupt .
" " True : no doubt he may appear so to a stranger , but I am so accustomed to his manner , I never think of it ; and then , if he has peculiarities of temper , allowance should be made .
" " Why ?
" " Partly because it is his nature—and we can none of us help our nature ; and partly because he has painful thoughts , no doubt , to harass him , and make his spirits unequal .
" " What about ?
" " Family troubles , for one thing .
" " But he has no family .
" " Not now , but he has had—or , at least , relatives .
He lost his elder brother a few years since .
" " His _ elder _ brother ?
" " Yes .
The present Mr. Rochester has not been very long in possession of the property ; only about nine years .
" " Nine years is a tolerable time .
Was he so very fond of his brother as to be still inconsolable for his loss ?
" " Why , no—perhaps not .
I believe there were some misunderstandings between them .
Mr. Rowland Rochester was not quite just to Mr. Edward ; and perhaps he prejudiced his father against him .
The old gentleman was fond of money , and anxious to keep the family estate together .
He did not like to diminish the property by division , and yet he was anxious that Mr. Edward should have wealth , too , to keep up the consequence of the name ; and , soon after he was of age , some steps were taken that were not quite fair , and made a great deal of mischief .
Old Mr. Rochester and Mr. Rowland combined to bring Mr. Edward into what he considered a painful position , for the sake of making his fortune : what the precise nature of that position was I never clearly knew , but his spirit could not brook what he had to suffer in it .
He is not very forgiving : he broke with his family , and now for many years he has led an unsettled kind of life .
I don 't think he has ever been resident at Thornfield for a fortnight together , since the death of his brother without a will left him master of the estate ; and , indeed , no wonder he shuns the old place .
" " Why should he shun it ?
" " Perhaps he thinks it gloomy .
" The answer was evasive . I should have liked something clearer ; but Mrs. Fairfax either could not , or would not , give me more explicit information of the origin and nature of Mr. Rochester 's trials .
She averred they were a mystery to herself , and that what she knew was chiefly from conjecture .
It was evident , indeed , that she wished me to drop the subject , which I did accordingly .
For several subsequent days I saw little of Mr. Rochester .
In the mornings he seemed much engaged with business , and , in the afternoon , gentlemen from Millcote or the neighbourhood called , and sometimes stayed to dine with him .
When his sprain was well enough to admit of horse exercise , he rode out a good deal ; probably to return these visits , as he generally did not come back till late at night .
During this interval , even Adele was seldom sent for to his presence , and all my acquaintance with him was confined to an occasional rencontre in the hall , on the stairs , or in the gallery , when he would sometimes pass me haughtily and coldly , just acknowledging my presence by a distant nod or a cool glance , and sometimes bow and smile with gentlemanlike affability .
His changes of mood did not offend me , because I saw that I had nothing to do with their alternation ; the ebb and flow depended on causes quite disconnected with me .
One day he had had company to dinner , and had sent for my portfolio ; in order , doubtless , to exhibit its contents : the gentlemen went away early , to attend a public meeting at Millcote , as Mrs. Fairfax informed me ; but the night being wet and inclement , Mr. Rochester did not accompany them .
Soon after they were gone he rang the bell : a message came that I and Adele were to go downstairs .
I brushed Adele 's hair and made her neat , and having ascertained that I was myself in my usual Quaker trim , where there was nothing to retouch—all being too close and plain , braided locks included , to admit of disarrangement—we descended , Adele wondering whether the _ petit coffre _ was at length come ; for , owing to some mistake , its arrival had hitherto been delayed .
She was gratified : there it stood , a little carton , on the table when we entered the dining-room .
She appeared to know it by instinct .
" Ma boite ! ma boite !
" exclaimed she , running towards it .
" Yes , there is your ' boite ' at last : take it into a corner , you genuine daughter of Paris , and amuse yourself with disembowelling it , " said the deep and rather sarcastic voice of Mr. Rochester , proceeding from the depths of an immense easy-chair at the fireside .
" And mind , " he continued , " don 't bother me with any details of the anatomical process , or any notice of the condition of the entrails : let your operation be conducted in silence : tiens-toi tranquille , enfant ; comprends-tu ?
" Adele seemed scarcely to need the warning—she had already retired to a sofa with her treasure , and was busy untying the cord which secured the lid .
Having removed this impediment , and lifted certain silvery envelopes of tissue paper , she merely exclaimed— " Oh ciel ! Que c 'est beau !
" and then remained absorbed in ecstatic contemplation .
" Is Miss Eyre there ?
" now demanded the master , half rising from his seat to look round to the door , near which I still stood .
" Ah ! well , come forward ; be seated here .
" He drew a chair near his own .
" I am not fond of the prattle of children , " he continued ; " for , old bachelor as I am , I have no pleasant associations connected with their lisp .
It would be intolerable to me to pass a whole evening _ tete-a-tete _ with a brat .
Don 't draw that chair farther off , Miss Eyre ; sit down exactly where I placed it—if you please , that is .
Confound these civilities !
I continually forget them .
Nor do I particularly affect simple-minded old ladies .
By-the-bye , I must have mine in mind ; it won 't do to neglect her ; she is a Fairfax , or wed to one ; and blood is said to be thicker than water .
" He rang , and despatched an invitation to Mrs. Fairfax , who soon arrived , knitting-basket in hand .
" Good evening , madam ; I sent to you for a charitable purpose . I have forbidden Adele to talk to me about her presents , and she is bursting with repletion : have the goodness to serve her as auditress and interlocutrice ; it will be one of the most benevolent acts you ever performed .
" Adele , indeed , no sooner saw Mrs. Fairfax , than she summoned her to her sofa , and there quickly filled her lap with the porcelain , the ivory , the waxen contents of her " boite ;
" pouring out , meantime , explanations and raptures in such broken English as she was mistress of .
" Now I have performed the part of a good host , " pursued Mr. Rochester , " put my guests into the way of amusing each other , I ought to be at liberty to attend to my own pleasure .
Miss Eyre , draw your chair still a little farther forward : you are yet too far back ;
I cannot see you without disturbing my position in this comfortable chair , which I have no mind to do .
" I did as I was bid , though I would much rather have remained somewhat in the shade ; but Mr. Rochester had such a direct way of giving orders , it seemed a matter of course to obey him promptly .
We were , as I have said , in the dining-room : the lustre , which had been lit for dinner , filled the room with a festal breadth of light ; the large fire was all red and clear ; the purple curtains hung rich and ample before the lofty window and loftier arch ; everything was still , save the subdued chat of Adele ( she dared not speak loud ) , and , filling up each pause , the beating of winter rain against the panes .
Mr. Rochester , as he sat in his damask-covered chair , looked different to what I had seen him look before ; not quite so stern—much less gloomy .
There was a smile on his lips , and his eyes sparkled , whether with wine or not , I am not sure ; but I think it very probable .
He was , in short , in his after-dinner mood ; more expanded and genial , and also more self- indulgent than the frigid and rigid temper of the morning ; still he looked preciously grim , cushioning his massive head against the swelling back of his chair , and receiving the light of the fire on his granite- hewn features , and in his great , dark eyes ; for he had great , dark eyes , and very fine eyes , too—not without a certain change in their depths sometimes , which , if it was not softness , reminded you , at least , of that feeling .
He had been looking two minutes at the fire , and I had been looking the same length of time at him , when , turning suddenly , he caught my gaze fastened on his physiognomy .
" You examine me , Miss Eyre , " said he : " do you think me handsome ?
" I should , if I had deliberated , have replied to this question by something conventionally vague and polite ; but the answer somehow slipped from my tongue before I was aware — " No , sir .
" " Ah !
By my word ! there is something singular about you , " said he : " you have the air of a little _ nonnette _ ; quaint , quiet , grave , and simple , as you sit with your hands before you , and your eyes generally bent on the carpet ( except , by-the-bye , when they are directed piercingly to my face ; as just now , for instance ) ; and when one asks you a question , or makes a remark to which you are obliged to reply , you rap out a round rejoinder , which , if not blunt , is at least brusque .
What do you mean by it ?
" " Sir , I was too plain ;
I beg your pardon .
I ought to have replied that it was not easy to give an impromptu answer to a question about appearances ; that tastes mostly differ ; and that beauty is of little consequence , or something of that sort .
" " You ought to have replied no such thing .
Beauty of little consequence , indeed !
And so , under pretence of softening the previous outrage , of stroking and soothing me into placidity , you stick a sly penknife under my ear !
Go on : what fault do you find with me , pray ?
I suppose I have all my limbs and all my features like any other man ?
" " Mr. Rochester , allow me to disown my first answer : I intended no pointed repartee : it was only a blunder .
" " Just so : I think so : and you shall be answerable for it .
Criticise me : does my forehead not please you ?
" He lifted up the sable waves of hair which lay horizontally over his brow , and showed a solid enough mass of intellectual organs , but an abrupt deficiency where the suave sign of benevolence should have risen .
" Now , ma 'am , am I a fool ?
" " Sir , I was too plain ;
" I should , if I had deliberated , have replied to this question by something conventionally vague and polite ; but the answer somehow slipped from my tongue before I was aware — " No , sir .
" " Ah !
And so , under pretence of softening the previous outrage , of stroking and soothing me into placidity , you stick a sly penknife under my ear !

" He lifted up the sable waves of hair which lay horizontally over his brow , and showed a solid enough mass of intellectual organs , but an abrupt deficiency where the suave sign of benevolence should have risen .
During this interval , even Adele was seldom sent for to his presence , and all my acquaintance with him was confined to an occasional rencontre in the hall , on the stairs , or in the gallery , when he would sometimes pass me haughtily and coldly , just acknowledging my presence by a distant nod or a cool glance , and sometimes bow and smile with gentlemanlike affability .
" And mind , " he continued , " don 't bother me with any details of the anatomical process , or any notice of the condition of the entrails : let your operation be conducted in silence : tiens-toi tranquille , enfant ; comprends-tu ?
" " Yes .
" Is Miss Eyre there ?
" " What about ?
" " What about ?
" The answer was evasive .
" Well , is he ?
Don 't draw that chair farther off , Miss Eyre ; sit down exactly where I placed it—if you please , that is .
" Good evening , madam ;
" He drew a chair near his own .
" You said Mr. Rochester was not strikingly peculiar , Mrs. Fairfax , " I observed , when I rejoined her in her room , after putting Adele to bed .
He was , in short , in his after-dinner mood ; more expanded and genial , and also more self- indulgent than the frigid and rigid temper of the morning ; still he looked preciously grim , cushioning his massive head against the swelling back of his chair , and receiving the light of the fire on his granite- hewn features , and in his great , dark eyes ; for he had great , dark eyes , and very fine eyes , too—not without a certain change in their depths sometimes , which , if it was not softness , reminded you , at least , of that feeling .
" I should , if I had deliberated , have replied to this question by something conventionally vague and polite ; but the answer somehow slipped from my tongue before I was aware — " No , sir .
Miss Eyre , draw your chair still a little farther forward : you are yet too far back ;
I should have liked something clearer ; but Mrs. Fairfax either could not , or would not , give me more explicit information of the origin and nature of Mr. Rochester 's trials .
" You said Mr. Rochester was not strikingly peculiar , Mrs. Fairfax , " I observed , when I rejoined her in her room , after putting Adele to bed .
I continually forget them .
" I am willing to amuse you , if I can , sir—quite willing ; but I cannot introduce a topic , because how do I know what will interest you ?
It would please me now to draw you out—to learn more of you—therefore speak .
" Instead of speaking , I smiled ; and not a very complacent or submissive smile either .
" Instead of speaking , I smiled ; and not a very complacent or submissive smile either .
" exclaimed she , running towards it .
" What about , sir ?
" " Whatever you like .
" I am willing to amuse you , if I can , sir—quite willing ; but I cannot introduce a topic , because how do I know what will interest you ?
" Accordingly I sat and said nothing : " If he expects me to talk for the mere sake of talking and showing off , he will find he has addressed himself to the wrong person , " I thought .
" Is Miss Eyre there ?
" I was dumb still .
He bent his head a little towards me , and with a single hasty glance seemed to dive into my eyes .
" Stubborn ?
" Well , is he ?
" Well , is he ?
" I should , if I had deliberated , have replied to this question by something conventionally vague and polite ; but the answer somehow slipped from my tongue before I was aware — " No , sir .
I beg your pardon .
Then take my word for it , —I am not a villain : you are not to suppose that—not to attribute to me any such bad eminence ; but , owing , I verily believe , rather to circumstances than to my natural bent , I am a trite commonplace sinner , hackneyed in all the poor petty dissipations with which the rich and worthless try to put on life .
" " I don 't think , sir , you have a right to command me , merely because you are older than I , or because you have seen more of the world than I have ; your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your time and experience .
I have forbidden Adele to talk to me about her presents , and she is bursting with repletion : have the goodness to serve her as auditress and interlocutrice ; it will be one of the most benevolent acts you ever performed .
" He had deigned an explanation , almost an apology , and I did not feel insensible to his condescension , and would not seem so .
" I am willing to amuse you , if I can , sir—quite willing ; but I cannot introduce a topic , because how do I know what will interest you ?
" " Just so : I think so : and you shall be answerable for it .
" " Then , in the first place , do you agree with me that I have a right to be a little masterful , abrupt , perhaps exacting , sometimes , on the grounds I stated , namely , that I am old enough to be your father , and that I have battled through a varied experience with many men of many nations , and roamed over half the globe , while you have lived quietly with one set of people in one house ?
" " Whatever you like .
" " Mr. Rochester , allow me to disown my first answer : I intended no pointed repartee : it was only a blunder .
" " I don 't think , sir , you have a right to command me , merely because you are older than I , or because you have seen more of the world than I have ; your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your time and experience .
" " I don 't think , sir , you have a right to command me , merely because you are older than I , or because you have seen more of the world than I have ; your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your time and experience .
" " Ah !
Que c 'est beau !
Then take my word for it , —I am not a villain : you are not to suppose that—not to attribute to me any such bad eminence ; but , owing , I verily believe , rather to circumstances than to my natural bent , I am a trite commonplace sinner , hackneyed in all the poor petty dissipations with which the rich and worthless try to put on life .

" " What about ?
Do you wonder that I avow this to you ?
" Well , is he ?
" " Sir , I was too plain ;
Que c 'est beau !
Do you wonder that I avow this to you ?
" I am willing to amuse you , if I can , sir—quite willing ; but I cannot introduce a topic , because how do I know what will interest you ?
" I should , if I had deliberated , have replied to this question by something conventionally vague and polite ; but the answer somehow slipped from my tongue before I was aware — " No , sir .

" " Ah !
" " Not at all—it bears the most gracious message in the world : for the rest , you are not my conscience-keeper , so don 't make yourself uneasy .
By my word ! there is something singular about you , " said he : " you have the air of a little _ nonnette _ ; quaint , quiet , grave , and simple , as you sit with your hands before you , and your eyes generally bent on the carpet ( except , by-the-bye , when they are directed piercingly to my face ; as just now , for instance ) ; and when one asks you a question , or makes a remark to which you are obliged to reply , you rap out a round rejoinder , which , if not blunt , is at least brusque .
" " You ought to have replied no such thing .
Then take my word for it , —I am not a villain : you are not to suppose that—not to attribute to me any such bad eminence ; but , owing , I verily believe , rather to circumstances than to my natural bent , I am a trite commonplace sinner , hackneyed in all the poor petty dissipations with which the rich and worthless try to put on life .
" " Decidedly he has had too much wine , " I thought ; and I did not know what answer to make to his queer question : how could I tell whether he was capable of being re-transformed ?
" I have plenty of faults of my own : I know it , and I don 't wish to palliate them , I assure you .
" " Just so : I think so : and you shall be answerable for it .
He bent his head a little towards me , and with a single hasty glance seemed to dive into my eyes .
" I have plenty of faults of my own : I know it , and I don 't wish to palliate them , I assure you .
I wish I had stood firm—God knows I do !
I have almost forgotten you since : other ideas have driven yours from my head ; but to-night I am resolved to be at ease ; to dismiss what importunes , and recall what pleases .
When I was as old as you , I was a feeling fellow enough , partial to the unfledged , unfostered , and unlucky ; but Fortune has knocked me about since : she has even kneaded me with her knuckles , and now I flatter myself I am hard and tough as an India-rubber ball ; pervious , though , through a chink or two still , and with one sentient point in the middle of the lump .
" " Mr. Rochester , allow me to disown my first answer : I intended no pointed repartee : it was only a blunder .
I envy you your peace of mind , your clean conscience , your unpolluted memory .
" Stubborn ?
" " All right then ; limpid , salubrious : no gush of bilge water had turned it to fetid puddle .
I was your equal at eighteen—quite your equal .
Nature meant me to be , on the whole , a good man , Miss Eyre ; one of the better kind , and you see I am not so .
You would say you don 't see it ; at least I flatter myself I read as much in your eye ( beware , by-the-bye , what you express with that organ ; I am quick at interpreting its language ) .
Then take my word for it , —I am not a villain : you are not to suppose that—not to attribute to me any such bad eminence ; but , owing , I verily believe , rather to circumstances than to my natural bent , I am a trite commonplace sinner , hackneyed in all the poor petty dissipations with which the rich and worthless try to put on life .
Do you wonder that I avow this to you ?
Know , that in the course of your future life you will often find yourself elected the involuntary confidant of your acquaintances ' secrets : people will instinctively find out , as I have done , that it is not your forte to tell of yourself , but to listen while others talk of themselves ; they will feel , too , that you listen with no malevolent scorn of their indiscretion , but with a kind of innate sympathy ; not the less comforting and encouraging because it is very unobtrusive in its manifestations .
" " How do you know ? —how can you guess all this , sir ?
" " I know it well ; therefore I proceed almost as freely as if I were writing my thoughts in a diary .
You would say , I should have been superior to circumstances ; so I should—so I should ; but you see I was not .
When fate wronged me , I had not the wisdom to remain cool : I turned desperate ; then I degenerated .
Now , when any vicious simpleton excites my disgust by his paltry ribaldry , I cannot flatter myself that I am better than he : I am forced to confess that he and I are on a level .
I wish I had stood firm—God knows I do !
Dread remorse when you are tempted to err , Miss Eyre ; remorse is the poison of life .
" " Repentance is said to be its cure , sir .
" " It is not its cure .
Reformation may be its cure ; and I could reform—I have strength yet for that—if—but where is the use of thinking of it , hampered , burdened , cursed as I am ?
Besides , since happiness is irrevocably denied me , I have a right to get pleasure out of life : and I _ will _ get it , cost what it may .
" " Then you will degenerate still more , sir .
" " Possibly : yet why should I , if I can get sweet , fresh pleasure ?
And I may get it as sweet and fresh as the wild honey the bee gathers on the moor .
" " It will sting—it will taste bitter , sir .
" " How do you know ? —you never tried it .
How very serious—how very solemn you look : and you are as ignorant of the matter as this cameo head " ( taking one from the mantelpiece ) .
" You have no right to preach to me , you neophyte , that have not passed the porch of life , and are absolutely unacquainted with its mysteries .
" " I only remind you of your own words , sir : you said error brought remorse , and you pronounced remorse the poison of existence .
" " And who talks of error now ?
I scarcely think the notion that flittered across my brain was an error .
I believe it was an inspiration rather than a temptation : it was very genial , very soothing—I know that .
Here it comes again !
It is no devil , I assure you ; or if it be , it has put on the robes of an angel of light .
I think I must admit so fair a guest when it asks entrance to my heart .
" " Distrust it , sir ; it is not a true angel .
" " Once more , how do you know ?
By what instinct do you pretend to distinguish between a fallen seraph of the abyss and a messenger from the eternal throne—between a guide and a seducer ?
" " I judged by your countenance , sir , which was troubled when you said the suggestion had returned upon you .
I feel sure it will work you more misery if you listen to it .
" " Not at all—it bears the most gracious message in the world : for the rest , you are not my conscience-keeper , so don 't make yourself uneasy .
Here , come in , bonny wanderer !
" He said this as if he spoke to a vision , viewless to any eye but his own ; then , folding his arms , which he had half extended , on his chest , he seemed to enclose in their embrace the invisible being .
" Now , " he continued , again addressing me , " I have received the pilgrim—a disguised deity , as I verily believe .
Already it has done me good : my heart was a sort of charnel ; it will now be a shrine .
" " To speak truth , sir , I don 't understand you at all : I cannot keep up the conversation , because it has got out of my depth .
Only one thing , I know : you said you were not as good as you should like to be , and that you regretted your own imperfection ; —one thing I can comprehend : you intimated that to have a sullied memory was a perpetual bane .
It seems to me , that if you tried hard , you would in time find it possible to become what you yourself would approve ; and that if from this day you began with resolution to correct your thoughts and actions , you would in a few years have laid up a new and stainless store of recollections , to which you might revert with pleasure .
" " Justly thought ; rightly said , Miss Eyre ; and , at this moment , I am paving hell with energy .
" " Sir ?
" " I am laying down good intentions , which I believe durable as flint .
Certainly , my associates and pursuits shall be other than they have been .
" " And better ?
" " And better—so much better as pure ore is than foul dross .
You seem to doubt me ;
I don 't doubt myself : I know what my aim is , what my motives are ; and at this moment I pass a law , unalterable as that of the Medes and Persians , that both are right .
" " They cannot be , sir , if they require a new statute to legalise them .
" " They are , Miss Eyre , though they absolutely require a new statute : unheard-of combinations of circumstances demand unheard-of rules .
" " That sounds a dangerous maxim , sir ; because one can see at once that it is liable to abuse .
" " Sententious sage ! so it is : but I swear by my household gods not to abuse it .
" " You are human and fallible .
" " I am : so are you—what then ?
" " The human and fallible should not arrogate a power with which the divine and perfect alone can be safely intrusted .
" " What power ?
" " That of saying of any strange , unsanctioned line of action , — ' Let it be right .
' " " ' Let it be right ' —the very words : you have pronounced them .
" " _ May _ it be right then , " I said , as I rose , deeming it useless to continue a discourse which was all darkness to me ; and , besides , sensible that the character of my interlocutor was beyond my penetration ; at least , beyond its present reach ; and feeling the uncertainty , the vague sense of insecurity , which accompanies a conviction of ignorance .
" Where are you going ?
" " To put Adele to bed : it is past her bedtime .
" " You are afraid of me , because I talk like a Sphynx .
" " Your language is enigmatical , sir : but though I am bewildered , I am certainly not afraid .
" " You _ are _ afraid—your self-love dreads a blunder .
" " In that sense I do feel apprehensive—I have no wish to talk nonsense .
" " If you did , it would be in such a grave , quiet manner , I should mistake it for sense .
Do you never laugh , Miss Eyre ?
Don 't trouble yourself to answer—I see you laugh rarely ; but you can laugh very merrily : believe me , you are not naturally austere , any more than I am naturally vicious .
The Lowood constraint still clings to you somewhat ; controlling your features , muffling your voice , and restricting your limbs ; and you fear in the presence of a man and a brother—or father , or master , or what you will—to smile too gaily , speak too freely , or move too quickly : but , in time , I think you will learn to be natural with me , as I find it impossible to be conventional with you ; and then your looks and movements will have more vivacity and variety than they dare offer now .
I see at intervals the glance of a curious sort of bird through the close-set bars of a cage : a vivid , restless , resolute captive is there ; were it but free , it would soar cloud-high .
You are still bent on going ?
" " It has struck nine , sir .
" " Never mind , —wait a minute : Adele is not ready to go to bed yet .
My position , Miss Eyre , with my back to the fire , and my face to the room , favours observation .
While talking to you , I have also occasionally watched Adele ( I have my own reasons for thinking her a curious study , —reasons that I may , nay , that I shall , impart to you some day ) .
She pulled out of her box , about ten minutes ago , a little pink silk frock ; rapture lit her face as she unfolded it ; coquetry runs in her blood , blends with her brains , and seasons the marrow of her bones .
' Il faut que je l 'essaie ! ' cried she , ' et a l 'instant meme !
' and she rushed out of the room .
She is now with Sophie , undergoing a robing process : in a few minutes she will re-enter ; and I know what I shall see , —a miniature of Celine Varens , as she used to appear on the boards at the rising of—But never mind that .
However , my tenderest feelings are about to receive a shock : such is my presentiment ; stay now , to see whether it will be realised .
" Ere long , Adele 's little foot was heard tripping across the hall .
She entered , transformed as her guardian had predicted .
A dress of rose-coloured satin , very short , and as full in the skirt as it could be gathered , replaced the brown frock she had previously worn ; a wreath of rosebuds circled her forehead ; her feet were dressed in silk stockings and small white satin sandals .
" Est-ce que ma robe va bien ?
" et mes souliers ? et mes bas ?
' Il faut que je l 'essaie !
' and she rushed out of the room .
" He said this as if he spoke to a vision , viewless to any eye but his own ; then , folding his arms , which he had half extended , on his chest , he seemed to enclose in their embrace the invisible being .
Here it comes again !
" Est-ce que ma robe va bien ?

" " Once more , how do you know ?
' Il faut que je l 'essaie !
" And spreading out her dress , she chasseed across the room till , having reached Mr. Rochester , she wheeled lightly round before him on tip-toe , then dropped on one knee at his feet , exclaiming— " Monsieur , je vous remercie mille fois de votre bonte ;
While talking to you , I have also occasionally watched Adele ( I have my own reasons for thinking her a curious study , —reasons that I may , nay , that I shall , impart to you some day ) .
" et mes souliers ? et mes bas ?

" I like this day ;
I like Thornfield , its antiquity , its retirement , its old crow-trees and thorn-trees , its grey facade , and lines of dark windows reflecting that metal welkin : and yet how long have I abhorred the very thought of it , shunned it like a great plague-house ?

I meditated wonderingly on this incident ; but gradually quitting it , as I found it for the present inexplicable , I turned to the consideration of my master 's manner to myself .
" Oh , I had forgotten Celine !
The carriage stopped , as I had expected , at the hotel door ; my flame ( that is the very word for an opera inamorata ) alighted : though muffed in a cloak—an unnecessary encumbrance , by-the-bye , on so warm a June evening—I knew her instantly by her little foot , seen peeping from the skirt of her dress , as she skipped from the carriage-step .
Here it comes again !
' and she rushed out of the room .
" Strange that I should choose you for the confidant of all this , young lady ; passing strange that you should listen to me quietly , as if it were the most usual thing in the world for a man like me to tell stories of his opera-mistresses to a quaint , inexperienced girl like you !
His deportment had now for some weeks been more uniform towards me than at the first .

" This passion Celine had professed to return with even superior ardour .
The couple were thus revealed to me clearly : both removed their cloaks , and there was ' the Varens , ' shining in satin and jewels , —my gifts of course , —and there was her companion in an officer 's uniform ; and I knew him for a young roue of a vicomte—a brainless and vicious youth whom I had sometimes met in society , and had never thought of hating because I despised him so absolutely .

Just then it seemed my chamber-door was touched ; as if fingers had swept the panels in groping a way along the dark gallery outside .
I never seemed in his way ; he did not take fits of chilling hauteur : when he met me unexpectedly , the encounter seemed welcome ; he had always a word and sometimes a smile for me : when summoned by formal invitation to his presence , I was honoured by a cordiality of reception that made me feel I really possessed the power to amuse him , and that these evening conferences were sought as much for his pleasure as for my benefit .
He then said that she was the daughter of a French opera-dancer , Celine Varens , towards whom he had once cherished what he called a " _ grande passion _ .
" Adele here ran before him with her shuttlecock .
" " To speak truth , sir , I don 't understand you at all : I cannot keep up the conversation , because it has got out of my depth .
' Il faut que je l 'essaie !
The couple were thus revealed to me clearly : both removed their cloaks , and there was ' the Varens , ' shining in satin and jewels , —my gifts of course , —and there was her companion in an officer 's uniform ; and I knew him for a young roue of a vicomte—a brainless and vicious youth whom I had sometimes met in society , and had never thought of hating because I despised him so absolutely .
When we went in , and I had removed her bonnet and coat , I took her on my knee ; kept her there an hour , allowing her to prattle as she liked : not rebuking even some little freedoms and trivialities into which she was apt to stray when much noticed , and which betrayed in her a superficiality of character , inherited probably from her mother , hardly congenial to an English mind .
But unluckily the Varens , six months before , had given me this filette Adele , who , she affirmed , was my daughter ; and perhaps she may be , though I see no proofs of such grim paternity written in her countenance : Pilot is more like me than she .
His deportment had now for some weeks been more uniform towards me than at the first .
" But I stayed out a few minutes longer with Adele and Pilot—ran a race with her , and played a game of battledore and shuttlecock .
" " No : Adele is not answerable for either her mother 's faults or yours : I have a regard for her ; and now that I know she is , in a sense , parentless—forsaken by her mother and disowned by you , sir—I shall cling closer to her than before .
I thought no more of Mrs. Fairfax ;
" Why not ?
" " No : Adele is not answerable for either her mother 's faults or yours : I have a regard for her ; and now that I know she is , in a sense , parentless—forsaken by her mother and disowned by you , sir—I shall cling closer to her than before .
How could I possibly prefer the spoilt pet of a wealthy family , who would hate her governess as a nuisance , to a lonely little orphan , who leans towards her as a friend ?
" " Oh , that is the light in which you view it !
Well , I must go in now ; and you too : it darkens .
" But I stayed out a few minutes longer with Adele and Pilot—ran a race with her , and played a game of battledore and shuttlecock .
When we went in , and I had removed her bonnet and coat , I took her on my knee ; kept her there an hour , allowing her to prattle as she liked : not rebuking even some little freedoms and trivialities into which she was apt to stray when much noticed , and which betrayed in her a superficiality of character , inherited probably from her mother , hardly congenial to an English mind .
Still she had her merits ; and I was disposed to appreciate all that was good in her to the utmost .
I sought in her countenance and features a likeness to Mr. Rochester , but found none : no trait , no turn of expression announced relationship .
It was a pity : if she could but have been proved to resemble him , he would have thought more of her .
It was not till after I had withdrawn to my own chamber for the night , that I steadily reviewed the tale Mr. Rochester had told me .
As he had said , there was probably nothing at all extraordinary in the substance of the narrative itself : a wealthy Englishman 's passion for a French dancer , and her treachery to him , were every-day matters enough , no doubt , in society ; but there was something decidedly strange in the paroxysm of emotion which had suddenly seized him when he was in the act of expressing the present contentment of his mood , and his newly revived pleasure in the old hall and its environs .
I meditated wonderingly on this incident ; but gradually quitting it , as I found it for the present inexplicable , I turned to the consideration of my master 's manner to myself .
The confidence he had thought fit to repose in me seemed a tribute to my discretion : I regarded and accepted it as such .
His deportment had now for some weeks been more uniform towards me than at the first .
I never seemed in his way ; he did not take fits of chilling hauteur : when he met me unexpectedly , the encounter seemed welcome ; he had always a word and sometimes a smile for me : when summoned by formal invitation to his presence , I was honoured by a cordiality of reception that made me feel I really possessed the power to amuse him , and that these evening conferences were sought as much for his pleasure as for my benefit .
I , indeed , talked comparatively little , but I heard him talk with relish .
It was his nature to be communicative ; he liked to open to a mind unacquainted with the world glimpses of its scenes and ways ( I do not mean its corrupt scenes and wicked ways , but such as derived their interest from the great scale on which they were acted , the strange novelty by which they were characterised ) ; and I had a keen delight in receiving the new ideas he offered , in imagining the new pictures he portrayed , and following him in thought through the new regions he disclosed , never startled or troubled by one noxious allusion .
The ease of his manner freed me from painful restraint : the friendly frankness , as correct as cordial , with which he treated me , drew me to him .
I felt at times as if he were my relation rather than my master : yet he was imperious sometimes still ; but I did not mind that ; I saw it was his way .
So happy , so gratified did I become with this new interest added to life , that I ceased to pine after kindred : my thin crescent-destiny seemed to enlarge ; the blanks of existence were filled up ; my bodily health improved ;
I gathered flesh and strength .
And was Mr. Rochester now ugly in my eyes ?
No , reader : gratitude , and many associations , all pleasurable and genial , made his face the object I best liked to see ; his presence in a room was more cheering than the brightest fire .
Yet I had not forgotten his faults ; indeed , I could not , for he brought them frequently before me .
He was proud , sardonic , harsh to inferiority of every description : in my secret soul I knew that his great kindness to me was balanced by unjust severity to many others .
He was moody , too ; unaccountably so ;
I more than once , when sent for to read to him , found him sitting in his library alone , with his head bent on his folded arms ; and , when he looked up , a morose , almost a malignant , scowl blackened his features .
But I believed that his moodiness , his harshness , and his former faults of morality ( I say _ former _ , for now he seemed corrected of them ) had their source in some cruel cross of fate .
I believed he was naturally a man of better tendencies , higher principles , and purer tastes than such as circumstances had developed , education instilled , or destiny encouraged .
I thought there were excellent materials in him ; though for the present they hung together somewhat spoiled and tangled .
I cannot deny that I grieved for his grief , whatever that was , and would have given much to assuage it .
Though I had now extinguished my candle and was laid down in bed , I could not sleep for thinking of his look when he paused in the avenue , and told how his destiny had risen up before him , and dared him to be happy at Thornfield .
" Why not ?
" I asked myself .
" What alienates him from the house ?
Will he leave it again soon ?
Mrs. Fairfax said he seldom stayed here longer than a fortnight at a time ; and he has now been resident eight weeks .
If he does go , the change will be doleful .
Suppose he should be absent spring , summer , and autumn : how joyless sunshine and fine days will seem !
" I hardly know whether I had slept or not after this musing ; at any rate , I started wide awake on hearing a vague murmur , peculiar and lugubrious , which sounded , I thought , just above me .
I wished I had kept my candle burning : the night was drearily dark ; my spirits were depressed .
I rose and sat up in bed , listening .
The sound was hushed .
I tried again to sleep ; but my heart beat anxiously : my inward tranquillity was broken .
The clock , far down in the hall , struck two .
Just then it seemed my chamber-door was touched ; as if fingers had swept the panels in groping a way along the dark gallery outside .
I said , " Who is there ?
" Nothing answered .
I was chilled with fear .
All at once I remembered that it might be Pilot , who , when the kitchen- door chanced to be left open , not unfrequently found his way up to the threshold of Mr. Rochester 's chamber : I had seen him lying there myself in the mornings .
The idea calmed me somewhat : I lay down .
Silence composes the nerves ; and as an unbroken hush now reigned again through the whole house , I began to feel the return of slumber .
But it was not fated that I should sleep that night .
A dream had scarcely approached my ear , when it fled affrighted , scared by a marrow-freezing incident enough .
This was a demoniac laugh—low , suppressed , and deep—uttered , as it seemed , at the very keyhole of my chamber door .
The head of my bed was near the door , and I thought at first the goblin-laugher stood at my bedside—or rather , crouched by my pillow : but I rose , looked round , and could see nothing ; while , as I still gazed , the unnatural sound was reiterated : and I knew it came from behind the panels .
My first impulse was to rise and fasten the bolt ; my next , again to cry out , " Who is there ?
" Something gurgled and moaned .
Ere long , steps retreated up the gallery towards the third-storey staircase : a door had lately been made to shut in that staircase ;
I heard it open and close , and all was still .
" Was that Grace Poole ? and is she possessed with a devil ?
" thought I. Impossible now to remain longer by myself : I must go to Mrs. Fairfax .
I hurried on my frock and a shawl ;
I withdrew the bolt and opened the door with a trembling hand .
There was a candle burning just outside , and on the matting in the gallery .
I was surprised at this circumstance : but still more was I amazed to perceive the air quite dim , as if filled with smoke ; and , while looking to the right hand and left , to find whence these blue wreaths issued , I became further aware of a strong smell of burning .
Something creaked : it was a door ajar ; and that door was Mr. Rochester 's , and the smoke rushed in a cloud from thence .
I thought no more of Mrs. Fairfax ;
I thought no more of Grace Poole , or the laugh : in an instant , I was within the chamber .
Tongues of flame darted round the bed : the curtains were on fire .
In the midst of blaze and vapour , Mr. Rochester lay stretched motionless , in deep sleep .
" Wake ! wake !
" Wake ! wake !
I , indeed , talked comparatively little , but I heard him talk with relish .
The sound was hushed .
Tongues of flame darted round the bed : the curtains were on fire .
I was surprised at this circumstance : but still more was I amazed to perceive the air quite dim , as if filled with smoke ; and , while looking to the right hand and left , to find whence these blue wreaths issued , I became further aware of a strong smell of burning .
I briefly related to him what had transpired : the strange laugh I had heard in the gallery : the step ascending to the third storey ; the smoke , —the smell of fire which had conducted me to his room ; in what state I had found matters there , and how I had deluged him with all the water I could lay hands on .
All at once I remembered that it might be Pilot , who , when the kitchen- door chanced to be left open , not unfrequently found his way up to the threshold of Mr. Rochester 's chamber : I had seen him lying there myself in the mornings .
" I hardly know whether I had slept or not after this musing ; at any rate , I started wide awake on hearing a vague murmur , peculiar and lugubrious , which sounded , I thought , just above me .
" Is there a flood ?
" he cried .
" No , sir , " I answered ;
" Strange that I should choose you for the confidant of all this , young lady ; passing strange that you should listen to me quietly , as if it were the most usual thing in the world for a man like me to tell stories of his opera-mistresses to a quaint , inexperienced girl like you !
" he cried .
" What alienates him from the house ?
Who is in the room besides you ?
I was chilled with fear .
" No , sir , " I answered ;
" Something gurgled and moaned .
Suppose he should be absent spring , summer , and autumn : how joyless sunshine and fine days will seem !

" Monsieur , John has just been to say that your agent has called and wishes to see you .
" Nothing answered .
The sound was hushed .

The confidence he had thought fit to repose in me seemed a tribute to my discretion : I regarded and accepted it as such .
I rose and sat up in bed , listening .
" But I stayed out a few minutes longer with Adele and Pilot—ran a race with her , and played a game of battledore and shuttlecock .

" " There !

He was moody , too ; unaccountably so ;
" " Ah ! in that case I must abridge .

Who is in the room besides you ?
It was not till after I had withdrawn to my own chamber for the night , that I steadily reviewed the tale Mr. Rochester had told me .
I am up now ; but at your peril you fetch a candle yet : wait two minutes till I get into some dry garments , if any dry there be—yes , here is my dressing-gown .
" No , sir , " I answered ;
He listened very gravely ; his face , as I went on , expressed more concern than astonishment ; he did not immediately speak when I had concluded .
" " There !
Will he leave it again soon ?
" No , sir , " I answered ;
Suppose he should be absent spring , summer , and autumn : how joyless sunshine and fine days will seem !
Now run !
" I did run ;
" What have you done with me , witch , sorceress ?
Now run !
" What is it ? and who did it ?
" I did run ;
He was proud , sardonic , harsh to inferiority of every description : in my secret soul I knew that his great kindness to me was balanced by unjust severity to many others .
I felt at times as if he were my relation rather than my master : yet he was imperious sometimes still ; but I did not mind that ;

" He went : I watched the light withdraw .
I saw it was his way .
" " How , sir ?
Suppose he should be absent spring , summer , and autumn : how joyless sunshine and fine days will seem !
I never seemed in his way ; he did not take fits of chilling hauteur : when he met me unexpectedly , the encounter seemed welcome ; he had always a word and sometimes a smile for me : when summoned by formal invitation to his presence , I was honoured by a cordiality of reception that made me feel I really possessed the power to amuse him , and that these evening conferences were sought as much for his pleasure as for my benefit .
I , indeed , talked comparatively little , but I heard him talk with relish .
" Good-night again , sir .
" Strange energy was in his voice , strange fire in his look .
" " I was not dreaming , " I said , with some warmth , for her brazen coolness provoked me .
" What !
Now run !
" Good-night again , sir .
" Is there a flood ?
" " There !
Now run !
" But he still retained my hand , and I could not free it .
Besides , I know what sort of a mind I have placed in communication with my own : I know it is one not liable to take infection : it is a peculiar mind : it is a unique one .
" Shall I call Mrs. Fairfax ?
" " Just so .
" But he still retained my hand , and I could not free it .
I tried again to sleep ; but my heart beat anxiously : my inward tranquillity was broken .

" Mrs. Fairfax ?
" You have saved my life : I have a pleasure in owing you so immense a debt .
" " Then you are not in the habit of bolting your door every night before you get into bed ?
" " I wonder he waked nobody !
" " I wonder he waked nobody !
I shall do very well on the sofa in the library for the rest of the night .
" " Just so .
The head of my bed was near the door , and I thought at first the goblin-laugher stood at my bedside—or rather , crouched by my pillow : but I rose , looked round , and could see nothing ; while , as I still gazed , the unnatural sound was reiterated : and I knew it came from behind the panels .

She was intent on her work , in which her whole thoughts seemed absorbed : on her hard forehead , and in her commonplace features , was nothing either of the paleness or desperation one would have expected to see marking the countenance of a woman who had attempted murder , and whose intended victim had followed her last night to her lair , and ( as I believed ) , charged her with the crime she wished to perpetrate .
" I asked myself .
Again she looked at me ; and with the same scrutinising and conscious eye .
The idea struck me that if she discovered I knew or suspected her guilt , she would be playing of some of her malignant pranks on me ;
" " Good morning , Grace , " I said .
" But he still retained my hand , and I could not free it .
" I will put her to some test , " thought I : " such absolute impenetrability is past comprehension .
" " Good morning , Grace , " I said .
" I asked .
" Has anything happened here ?
I thought I heard the servants all talking together a while ago .
" " Only master had been reading in his bed last night ; he fell asleep with his candle lit , and the curtains got on fire ; but , fortunately , he awoke before the bed-clothes or the wood-work caught , and contrived to quench the flames with the water in the ewer .
" " A strange affair !
" I said , in a low voice : then , looking at her fixedly — " Did Mr. Rochester wake nobody ?
Did no one hear him move ?
" She again raised her eyes to me , and this time there was something of consciousness in their expression .
She seemed to examine me warily ; then she answered— " The servants sleep so far off , you know , Miss , they would not be likely to hear .
Mrs. Fairfax 's room and yours are the nearest to master 's ; but Mrs. Fairfax said she heard nothing : when people get elderly , they often sleep heavy .
" She paused , and then added , with a sort of assumed indifference , but still in a marked and significant tone— " But you are young , Miss ; and I should say a light sleeper : perhaps you may have heard a noise ?
" " I did , " said I , dropping my voice , so that Leah , who was still polishing the panes , could not hear me , " and at first I thought it was Pilot : but Pilot cannot laugh ; and I am certain I heard a laugh , and a strange one .
" She took a new needleful of thread , waxed it carefully , threaded her needle with a steady hand , and then observed , with perfect composure— " It is hardly likely master would laugh , I should think , Miss , when he was in such danger : You must have been dreaming .
" " I was not dreaming , " I said , with some warmth , for her brazen coolness provoked me .
Again she looked at me ; and with the same scrutinising and conscious eye .
" Have you told master that you heard a laugh ?
" she inquired .
" I have not had the opportunity of speaking to him this morning .
" " You did not think of opening your door and looking out into the gallery ?
" she further asked .
She appeared to be cross-questioning me , attempting to draw from me information unawares .
The idea struck me that if she discovered I knew or suspected her guilt , she would be playing of some of her malignant pranks on me ;
I thought it advisable to be on my guard .
" On the contrary , " said I , " I bolted my door .
" " Then you are not in the habit of bolting your door every night before you get into bed ?
" " Fiend ! she wants to know my habits , that she may lay her plans accordingly !
" Indignation again prevailed over prudence : I replied sharply , " Hitherto I have often omitted to fasten the bolt : I did not think it necessary .
I was not aware any danger or annoyance was to be dreaded at Thornfield Hall : but in future " ( and I laid marked stress on the words ) " I shall take good care to make all secure before I venture to lie down .
" " It will be wise so to do , " was her answer : " this neighbourhood is as quiet as any I know , and I never heard of the hall being attempted by robbers since it was a house ; though there are hundreds of pounds ' worth of plate in the plate-closet , as is well known .
And you see , for such a large house , there are very few servants , because master has never lived here much ; and when he does come , being a bachelor , he needs little waiting on : but I always think it best to err on the safe side ; a door is soon fastened , and it is as well to have a drawn bolt between one and any mischief that may be about .
A deal of people , Miss , are for trusting all to Providence ; but I say Providence will not dispense with the means , though He often blesses them when they are used discreetly .
" And here she closed her harangue : a long one for her , and uttered with the demureness of a Quakeress .
I still stood absolutely dumfoundered at what appeared to me her miraculous self-possession and most inscrutable hypocrisy , when the cook entered .
" Mrs. Poole , " said she , addressing Grace , " the servants ' dinner will soon be ready : will you come down ?
" " No ; just put my pint of porter and bit of pudding on a tray , and I 'll carry it upstairs .
" " You 'll have some meat ?
" " Just a morsel , and a taste of cheese , that 's all .
" " And the sago ?
" " Never mind it at present : I shall be coming down before teatime : I 'll make it myself .
" The cook here turned to me , saying that Mrs. Fairfax was waiting for me : so I departed .
I hardly heard Mrs. Fairfax 's account of the curtain conflagration during dinner , so much was I occupied in puzzling my brains over the enigmatical character of Grace Poole , and still more in pondering the problem of her position at Thornfield and questioning why she had not been given into custody that morning , or , at the very least , dismissed from her master 's service .
He had almost as much as declared his conviction of her criminality last night : what mysterious cause withheld him from accusing her ?
Why had he enjoined me , too , to secrecy ?
" " A strange affair !
It was strange : a bold , vindictive , and haughty gentleman seemed somehow in the power of one of the meanest of his dependants ; so much in her power , that even when she lifted her hand against his life , he dared not openly charge her with the attempt , much less punish her for it .
I don 't think she can ever have been pretty ; but , for aught I know , she may possess originality and strength of character to compensate for the want of personal advantages .
" Yet , " I reflected , " she has been young once ; her youth would be contemporary with her master 's : Mrs. Fairfax told me once , she had lived here many years .

" He held out his hand ;
Again she looked at me ; and with the same scrutinising and conscious eye .
" Qu ' avez-vous , mademoiselle ?
" said she .
" Vos doigts tremblent comme la feuille , et vos joues sont rouges : mais , rouges comme des cerises !

" she further asked .

Leah stood up in the window-seat , rubbing the panes of glass dimmed with smoke .

The idea struck me that if she discovered I knew or suspected her guilt , she would be playing of some of her malignant pranks on me ;
I thought sometimes I saw beyond its wild waters a shore , sweet as the hills of Beulah ; and now and then a freshening gale , wakened by hope , bore my spirit triumphantly towards the bourne : but I could not reach it , even in fancy—a counteracting breeze blew off land , and continually drove me back .
She looked up , while I still gazed at her : no start , no increase or failure of colour betrayed emotion , consciousness of guilt , or fear of detection .
To much confabulation succeeded a sound of scrubbing and setting to rights ; and when I passed the room , in going downstairs to dinner , I saw through the open door that all was again restored to complete order ; only the bed was stripped of its hangings .
But the morning passed just as usual : nothing happened to interrupt the quiet course of Adele 's studies ; only soon after breakfast , I heard some bustle in the neighbourhood of Mr. Rochester 's chamber , Mrs. Fairfax 's voice , and Leah 's , and the cook 's—that is , John 's wife—and even John 's own gruff tones .
" I said , in a low voice : then , looking at her fixedly — " Did Mr. Rochester wake nobody ?
" " I was not dreaming , " I said , with some warmth , for her brazen coolness provoked me .

" " Only master had been reading in his bed last night ; he fell asleep with his candle lit , and the curtains got on fire ; but , fortunately , he awoke before the bed-clothes or the wood-work caught , and contrived to quench the flames with the water in the ewer .
" Has anything happened here ?
" Good-night again , sir .
" I have not had the opportunity of speaking to him this morning .
" What !
" I said , in a low voice : then , looking at her fixedly — " Did Mr. Rochester wake nobody ?
" " I wonder he waked nobody !

It was strange : a bold , vindictive , and haughty gentleman seemed somehow in the power of one of the meanest of his dependants ; so much in her power , that even when she lifted her hand against his life , he dared not openly charge her with the attempt , much less punish her for it .
Mr. Rochester is an amateur of the decided and eccentric : Grace is eccentric at least .
I don 't think she can ever have been pretty ; but , for aught I know , she may possess originality and strength of character to compensate for the want of personal advantages .
" " And the sago ?
" She paused , and then added , with a sort of assumed indifference , but still in a marked and significant tone— " But you are young , Miss ; and I should say a light sleeper : perhaps you may have heard a noise ?
" I said , in a low voice : then , looking at her fixedly — " Did Mr. Rochester wake nobody ?
" I well remembered all ; language , glance , and tone seemed at the moment vividly renewed .
" Yet , " I reflected , " she has been young once ; her youth would be contemporary with her master 's : Mrs. Fairfax told me once , she had lived here many years .

" " There are Mrs. Eshton and her three daughters—very elegant young ladies indeed ; and there are the Honourable Blanche and Mary Ingram , most beautiful women , I suppose : indeed I have seen Blanche , six or seven years since , when she was a girl of eighteen .
" " And the sago ?
" He held out his hand ;
" Vos doigts tremblent comme la feuille , et vos joues sont rouges : mais , rouges comme des cerises !
" " There are Mrs. Eshton and her three daughters—very elegant young ladies indeed ; and there are the Honourable Blanche and Mary Ingram , most beautiful women , I suppose : indeed I have seen Blanche , six or seven years since , when she was a girl of eighteen .
There she sat , staid and taciturn-looking , as usual , in her brown stuff gown , her check apron , white handkerchief , and cap .
" Strange energy was in his voice , strange fire in his look .
" " Oh , quite well !
I don 't think she can ever have been pretty ; but , for aught I know , she may possess originality and strength of character to compensate for the want of personal advantages .
That woman was no other than Grace Poole .

I listened for Leah coming up with a message ;
Mr. Rochester has , on the whole , had a favourable day for his journey .
I listened for the bell to ring below ;
" " There are Mrs. Eshton and her three daughters—very elegant young ladies indeed ; and there are the Honourable Blanche and Mary Ingram , most beautiful women , I suppose : indeed I have seen Blanche , six or seven years since , when she was a girl of eighteen .

When once more alone , I reviewed the information I had got ; looked into my heart , examined its thoughts and feelings , and endeavoured to bring back with a strict hand such as had been straying through imagination 's boundless and trackless waste , into the safe fold of common sense .
Arraigned at my own bar , Memory having given her evidence of the hopes , wishes , sentiments I had been cherishing since last night—of the general state of mind in which I had indulged for nearly a fortnight past ;
" " Mr. Rochester ?
" " Do you expect him back to-night ?

" " A strange affair !
It little mattered whether my curiosity irritated him ;
You should have seen the dining-room that day—how richly it was decorated , how brilliantly lit up !
Again she looked at me ; and with the same scrutinising and conscious eye .
" Have you told master that you heard a laugh ?
" " Journey !
You should have seen the dining-room that day—how richly it was decorated , how brilliantly lit up !
She was intent on her work , in which her whole thoughts seemed absorbed : on her hard forehead , and in her commonplace features , was nothing either of the paleness or desperation one would have expected to see marking the countenance of a woman who had attempted murder , and whose intended victim had followed her last night to her lair , and ( as I believed ) , charged her with the crime she wished to perpetrate .
' " Afterwards , take a piece of smooth ivory—you have one prepared in your drawing-box : take your palette , mix your freshest , finest , clearest tints ; choose your most delicate camel-hair pencils ; delineate carefully the loveliest face you can imagine ; paint it in your softest shades and sweetest lines , according to the description given by Mrs. Fairfax of Blanche Ingram ; remember the raven ringlets , the oriental eye ;

I never felt better .
" " No ; just put my pint of porter and bit of pudding on a tray , and I 'll carry it upstairs .
" " Tall , fine bust , sloping shoulders ; long , graceful neck : olive complexion , dark and clear ; noble features ; eyes rather like Mr. Rochester 's : large and black , and as brilliant as her jewels .
Had Grace been young and handsome , I should have been tempted to think that tenderer feelings than prudence or fear influenced Mr. Rochester in her behalf ; but , hard-favoured and matronly as she was , the idea could not be admitted .
" Evening approaches , " said I , as I looked towards the window .
I went on thinking .

She wore an amber-coloured flower , too , in her hair : it contrasted well with the jetty mass of her curls .
I had more colour and more flesh , more life , more vivacity , because I had brighter hopes and keener enjoyments .

What if a former caprice ( a freak very possible to a nature so sudden and headstrong as his ) has delivered him into her power , and she now exercises over his actions a secret influence , the result of his own indiscretion , which he cannot shake off , and dare not disregard ?
I derived benefit from the task : it had kept my head and hands employed , and had given force and fixedness to the new impressions I wished to stamp indelibly on my heart .

" " True : yet I should scarcely fancy Mr. Rochester would entertain an idea of the sort .
I believe there is quite a party assembled there ;
Be sure that is the only tie he seriously acknowledges between you and him ; so don 't make him the object of your fine feelings , your raptures , agonies , and so forth .
He is not of your order : keep to your caste , and be too self-respecting to lavish the love of the whole heart , soul , and strength , where such a gift is not wanted and would be despised .
" I went on with my day 's business tranquilly ; but ever and anon vague suggestions kept wandering across my brain of reasons why I should quit Thornfield ; and I kept involuntarily framing advertisements and pondering conjectures about new situations : these thoughts I did not think to check ; they might germinate and bear fruit if they could .
Mr. Rochester had been absent upwards of a fortnight , when the post brought Mrs. Fairfax a letter .
" It is from the master , " said she , as she looked at the direction .
" Now I suppose we shall know whether we are to expect his return or not .
" And while she broke the seal and perused the document , I went on taking my coffee ( we were at breakfast ) : it was hot , and I attributed to that circumstance a fiery glow which suddenly rose to my face .
Why my hand shook , and why I involuntarily spilt half the contents of my cup into my saucer , I did not choose to consider .
" Well , I sometimes think we are too quiet ; but we run a chance of being busy enough now : for a little while at least , " said Mrs. Fairfax , still holding the note before her spectacles .
Ere I permitted myself to request an explanation , I tied the string of Adele 's pinafore , which happened to be loose : having helped her also to another bun and refilled her mug with milk , I said , nonchalantly— " Mr. Rochester is not likely to return soon , I suppose ?
" " Indeed he is—in three days , he says : that will be next Thursday ; and not alone either .
I don 't know how many of the fine people at the Leas are coming with him : he sends directions for all the best bedrooms to be prepared ; and the library and drawing-rooms are to be cleaned out ;
I am to get more kitchen hands from the George Inn , at Millcote , and from wherever else I can ; and the ladies will bring their maids and the gentlemen their valets : so we shall have a full house of it .
" And Mrs. Fairfax swallowed her breakfast and hastened away to commence operations .
The three days were , as she had foretold , busy enough .
I had thought all the rooms at Thornfield beautifully clean and well arranged ; but it appears I was mistaken .
Three women were got to help ; and such scrubbing , such brushing , such washing of paint and beating of carpets , such taking down and putting up of pictures , such polishing of mirrors and lustres , such lighting of fires in bedrooms , such airing of sheets and feather-beds on hearths , I never beheld , either before or since .
Adele ran quite wild in the midst of it : the preparations for company and the prospect of their arrival , seemed to throw her into ecstasies .
She would have Sophie to look over all her " toilettes , " as she called frocks ; to furbish up any that were " _ passees _ , " and to air and arrange the new .
For herself , she did nothing but caper about in the front chambers , jump on and off the bedsteads , and lie on the mattresses and piled-up bolsters and pillows before the enormous fires roaring in the chimneys .
From school duties she was exonerated : Mrs. Fairfax had pressed me into her service , and I was all day in the storeroom , helping ( or hindering ) her and the cook ; learning to make custards and cheese-cakes and French pastry , to truss game and garnish desert-dishes .
The party were expected to arrive on Thursday afternoon , in time for dinner at six .
During the intervening period I had no time to nurse chimeras ; and I believe I was as active and gay as anybody—Adele excepted .
Still , now and then , I received a damping check to my cheerfulness ; and was , in spite of myself , thrown back on the region of doubts and portents , and dark conjectures .
This was when I chanced to see the third-storey staircase door ( which of late had always been kept locked ) open slowly , and give passage to the form of Grace Poole , in prim cap , white apron , and handkerchief ; when I watched her glide along the gallery , her quiet tread muffled in a list slipper ; when I saw her look into the bustling , topsy-turvy bedrooms , —just say a word , perhaps , to the charwoman about the proper way to polish a grate , or clean a marble mantelpiece , or take stains from papered walls , and then pass on .
She would thus descend to the kitchen once a day , eat her dinner , smoke a moderate pipe on the hearth , and go back , carrying her pot of porter with her , for her private solace , in her own gloomy , upper haunt .
Only one hour in the twenty-four did she pass with her fellow-servants below ; all the rest of her time was spent in some low-ceiled , oaken chamber of the second storey : there she sat and sewed—and probably laughed drearily to herself , —as companionless as a prisoner in his dungeon .
The strangest thing of all was , that not a soul in the house , except me , noticed her habits , or seemed to marvel at them : no one discussed her position or employment ; no one pitied her solitude or isolation .
I once , indeed , overheard part of a dialogue between Leah and one of the charwomen , of which Grace formed the subject .
Leah had been saying something I had not caught , and the charwoman remarked— " She gets good wages , I guess ?
Not that I humbled myself by a slavish notion of inferiority : on the contrary , I just said— " You have nothing to do with the master of Thornfield , further than to receive the salary he gives you for teaching his protegee , and to be grateful for such respectful and kind treatment as , if you do your duty , you have a right to expect at his hands .
" " She was greatly admired , of course ?
—Is Mr. Rochester gone anywhere ?
During the intervening period I had no time to nurse chimeras ; and I believe I was as active and gay as anybody—Adele excepted .
But you see there is a considerable difference in age : Mr. Rochester is nearly forty ; she is but twenty-five .
" Well , I sometimes think we are too quiet ; but we run a chance of being busy enough now : for a little while at least , " said Mrs. Fairfax , still holding the note before her spectacles .
Leah had been saying something I had not caught , and the charwoman remarked— " She gets good wages , I guess ?
Leah had been saying something I had not caught , and the charwoman remarked— " She gets good wages , I guess ?
" " Oh ! yes .
" " Oh ! yes .
" I was about again to revert to the probability of a union between Mr. Rochester and the beautiful Blanche ; but Adele came in , and the conversation was turned into another channel .
She would thus descend to the kitchen once a day , eat her dinner , smoke a moderate pipe on the hearth , and go back , carrying her pot of porter with her , for her private solace , in her own gloomy , upper haunt .
" " That it is not !
" " And Miss Ingram : what sort of a voice had she ?
" " Yes , " said Leah ;
I had thought all the rooms at Thornfield beautifully clean and well arranged ; but it appears I was mistaken .
Three women were got to help ; and such scrubbing , such brushing , such washing of paint and beating of carpets , such taking down and putting up of pictures , such polishing of mirrors and lustres , such lighting of fires in bedrooms , such airing of sheets and feather-beds on hearths , I never beheld , either before or since .

She would have Sophie to look over all her " toilettes , " as she called frocks ; to furbish up any that were " _ passees _ , " and to air and arrange the new .
I was actually permitting myself to experience a sickening sense of disappointment ; but rallying my wits , and recollecting my principles , I at once called my sensations to order ; and it was wonderful how I got over the temporary blunder—how I cleared up the mistake of supposing Mr. Rochester 's movements a matter in which I had any cause to take a vital interest .
" " And what was she like ?

' " " I will not give him that trouble , " I answered .
" " No , indeed , I don 't ;
" It gets late , " said Mrs. Fairfax , entering in rustling state .
" " No , indeed , I don 't ;

I should not be called upon to quit my sanctum of the schoolroom ; for a sanctum it was now become to me , — " a very pleasant refuge in time of trouble .
Mr. Rochester has something else to think about .
" They 'll be here in ten minutes .
" " Indeed he is—in three days , he says : that will be next Thursday ; and not alone either .
Mrs. Fairfax said she should not be surprised if he were to go straight from the Leas to London , and thence to the Continent , and not show his face again at Thornfield for a year to come ; he had not unfrequently quitted it in a manner quite as abrupt and unexpected .
I had thought all the rooms at Thornfield beautifully clean and well arranged ; but it appears I was mistaken .
Mr. Rochester has something else to think about .

Adele , too , would be dressed : though I thought she had little chance of being introduced to the party that day at least .
Lady Lynn was a large and stout personage of about forty , very erect , very haughty-looking , richly dressed in a satin robe of changeful sheen : her dark hair shone glossily under the shade of an azure plume , and within the circlet of a band of gems .
Adele now petitioned to go down ; but I took her on my knee , and gave her to understand that she must not on any account think of venturing in sight of the ladies , either now or at any other time , unless expressly sent for : that Mr. Rochester would be very angry , & c .
I never saw a more splendid scene : the ladies were magnificently dressed ; most of them—at least most of the younger ones—looked handsome ; but Miss Ingram was certainly the queen .
" et alors quel dommage !
" Chez maman , " said she , " quand il y avait du monde , je le suivais partout , au salon et a leurs chambres ; souvent je regardais les femmes de chambre coiffer et habiller les dames , et c 'etait si amusant : comme cela on apprend .
We found the apartment vacant ; a large fire burning silently on the marble hearth , and wax candles shining in bright solitude , amid the exquisite flowers with which the tables were adorned .
A joyous stir was now audible in the hall : gentlemen 's deep tones and ladies ' silvery accents blent harmoniously together , and distinguishable above all , though not loud , was the sonorous voice of the master of Thornfield Hall , welcoming his fair and gallant guests under its roof .
Adele , who appeared to be still under the influence of a most solemnising impression , sat down , without a word , on the footstool I pointed out to her .
" And issuing from my asylum with precaution , I sought a back-stairs which conducted directly to the kitchen .
I looked at Adele , whose head leant against my shoulder ; her eyes were waxing heavy , so I took her up in my arms and carried her off to bed .
" " Don 't you feel hungry , Adele ?
" What beautiful ladies !

First , there was Mrs. Eshton and two of her daughters .
I never saw a more splendid scene : the ladies were magnificently dressed ; most of them—at least most of the younger ones—looked handsome ; but Miss Ingram was certainly the queen .
Of her daughters , the eldest , Amy , was rather little : naive , and child-like in face and manner , and piquant in form ; her white muslin dress and blue sash became her well .

Lady Lynn was a large and stout personage of about forty , very erect , very haughty-looking , richly dressed in a satin robe of changeful sheen : her dark hair shone glossily under the shade of an azure plume , and within the circlet of a band of gems .
Mrs. Colonel Dent was less showy ; but , I thought , more lady-like .
She had a slight figure , a pale , gentle face , and fair hair .

But the three most distinguished—partly , perhaps , because the tallest figures of the band—were the Dowager Lady Ingram and her daughters , Blanche and Mary .
" What beautiful ladies !
The Dowager might be between forty and fifty : her shape was still fine ; her hair ( by candle-light at least ) still black ; her teeth , too , were still apparently perfect .
Most people would have termed her a splendid woman of her age : and so she was , no doubt , physically speaking ; but then there was an expression of almost insupportable haughtiness in her bearing and countenance .
Her face was like her mother 's ; a youthful unfurrowed likeness : the same low brow , the same high features , the same pride .

First , I wished to see whether her appearance accorded with Mrs. Fairfax 's description ; secondly , whether it at all resembled the fancy miniature I had painted of her ; and thirdly—it will out ! —whether it were such as I should fancy likely to suit Mr. Rochester 's taste .

Presently a voice blent with the rich tones of the instrument ; it was a lady who sang , and very sweet her notes were .
Mary had a milder and more open countenance than Blanche ; softer features too , and a skin some shades fairer ( Miss Ingram was dark as a Spaniard ) —but Mary was deficient in life : her face lacked expression , her eye lustre ; she had nothing to say , and having once taken her seat , remained fixed like a statue in its niche .

First , there was Mrs. Eshton and two of her daughters .
The dessert was not carried out till after nine and at ten footmen were still running to and fro with trays and coffee- cups .
I could not proceed to the schoolroom without passing some of their doors , and running the risk of being surprised with my cargo of victualage ; so I stood still at this end , which , being windowless , was dark : quite dark now , for the sun was set and twilight gathering .
" " And she him , " I added ;
Their collective appearance had left on me an impression of high- born elegance , such as I had never before received .

Mr. Rochester has something else to think about .
" " And she him , " I added ;
I wish I could see her face ;
I listened long : suddenly I discovered that my ear was wholly intent on analysing the mingled sounds , and trying to discriminate amidst the confusion of accents those of Mr. Rochester ; and when it caught them , which it soon did , it found a further task in framing the tones , rendered by distance inarticulate , into words .
" " And she him , " I added ;
And did I now think Miss Ingram such a choice as Mr. Rochester would be likely to make ?
" et alors quel dommage !
I daresay Mr. Rochester will accompany him : it surprises me that he has already made so protracted a stay at Thornfield .

I turned my face away to conceal a smile I could not suppress : there was something ludicrous as well as painful in the little Parisienne 's earnest and innate devotion to matters of dress .
I cannot tell whether Miss Ingram was a genius , but she was self-conscious—remarkably self-conscious indeed .
I regarded her , of course , with special interest .

I pleaded off , and he admitted my plea .
How near had I approached him at that moment !

Besides , she added , a message might possibly come from Mr. Rochester when she was undressed ;

How near had I approached him at that moment !
I try to concentrate my attention on those netting-needles , on the meshes of the purse I am forming—I wish to think only of the work I have in my hands , to see only the silver beads and silk threads that lie in my lap ; whereas , I distinctly behold his figure , and I inevitably recall the moment when I last saw it ; just after I had rendered him , what he deemed , an essential service , and he , holding my hand , and looking down on my face , surveyed me with eyes that revealed a heart full and eager to overflow ; in whose emotions I had a part .

I believe he is of mine ;
I pointed out this circumstance to Mrs. Fairfax , who was standing at the window with me— " You said it was not likely they should think of being married , " said I , " but you see Mr. Rochester evidently prefers her to any of the other ladies .
Blasphemy against nature !
The collective appearance of the gentlemen , like that of the ladies , is very imposing : they are all costumed in black ; most of them are tall , some young .
Some of them threw themselves in half-reclining positions on the sofas and ottomans : some bent over the tables and examined the flowers and books : the rest gathered in a group round the fire : all talked in a low but clear tone which seemed habitual to them .
With whom will Blanche Ingram pair ?
" " Est-ce que je ne puis pas prendrie une seule de ces fleurs magnifiques , mademoiselle ?
" " Perhaps two or three weeks , certainly not more .
Mr. Rochester has something else to think about .
Amy and Louisa Eshton had cried out simultaneously— " What a love of a child !
He was talking , at the moment , to Louisa and Amy Eshton .
" No , you men never do consider economy and common sense .

And I was quite right : depend on that : there are a thousand reasons why liaisons between governesses and tutors should never be tolerated a moment in any well-regulated house ; firstly— " " Oh , gracious , mama !
The noble bust , the sloping shoulders , the graceful neck , the dark eyes and black ringlets were all there ; —but her face ?
" Mr. Rochester , I thought you were not fond of children ?
For when I say that I am of his kind , I do not mean that I have his force to influence , and his spell to attract ;
I could not tell—I did not know his taste in female beauty .
" No , you men never do consider economy and common sense .
I know I must conceal my sentiments : I must smother hope ;
" " Then no more need be said : change the subject .
I believe he is of mine ;

" He is not to them what he is to me , " I thought : " he is not of their kind .
Mr. Rochester , do you second my motion ?

" Coffee is handed .

" Lord Ingram , like his sisters , is very tall ; like them , also , he is handsome ; but he shares Mary 's apathetic and listless look : he seems to have more length of limb than vivacity of blood or vigour of brain .
" " Ha ! explain !
" " Ha ! explain !
" " Then no more need be said : change the subject .
" I should say the preference lies with you , " responded Colonel Dent .
" " Sing !

" Lady Lynn had remarked , " It is Mr. Rochester 's ward , I suppose—the little French girl he was speaking of .
Every good , true , vigorous feeling I have gathers impulsively round him .
I waited till the last deep and full vibration had expired—till the tide of talk , checked an instant , had resumed its flow ;
I wondered to see them receive with calm that look which seemed to me so penetrating : I expected their eyes to fall , their colour to rise under it ; yet I was glad when I found they were in no sense moved .
I saw Mr. Rochester smile : —his stern features softened ; his eye grew both brilliant and gentle , its ray both searching and sweet .
" cried Mr. Rochester .
" " What are they , madam ?
" commanded the lady .
" " Certainly , my best .
" " Did you speak , my own ?
" He is not to them what he is to me , " I thought : " he is not of their kind .
" On my honour , I am much obliged to you , " was the reply .
" " Did you speak , my own ?

Theodore , do you remember those merry days ?
What tricks Theodore and I used to play on our Miss Wilsons , and Mrs. Greys , and Madame Jouberts !
I waited till the last deep and full vibration had expired—till the tide of talk , checked an instant , had resumed its flow ;
" Poor , puny things , not fit to stir a step beyond papa 's park gates : nor to go even so far without mama 's permission and guardianship !
The noble bust , the sloping shoulders , the graceful neck , the dark eyes and black ringlets were all there ; —but her face ?

I took care to turn the tables .
" cried Mr. Rochester .
" " No , never : we might do what we pleased ; ransack her desk and her workbox , and turn her drawers inside out ; and she was so good-natured , she would give us anything we asked for .
" Mr. Rochester , I thought you were not fond of children ?
" " Yaas , to be sure I do , " drawled Lord Ingram ;
" He is not to them what he is to me , " I thought : " he is not of their kind .
I heard the dining-room door unclose ; a gentleman came out ; rising hastily , I stood face to face with him : it was Mr. Rochester .
" How do you do ?
" commanded the lady .
I took care to turn the tables .
" I feared—or should I say , hoped ? —the allusion to me would make Mr. Rochester glance my way ; and I involuntarily shrank farther into the shade : but he never turned his eyes .
I then quitted my sheltered corner and made my exit by the side-door , which was fortunately near .
" I should say the preference lies with you , " responded Colonel Dent .

I saw Mr. Rochester smile : —his stern features softened ; his eye grew both brilliant and gentle , its ray both searching and sweet .
She had , likewise , a fierce and a hard eye : it reminded me of Mrs. Reed 's ; she mouthed her words in speaking ; her voice was deep , its inflections very pompous , very dogmatical , —very intolerable , in short .

Now which of you most resembles Bothwell ?
" Mr. Rochester , I thought you were not fond of children ?
" I thought I might have retorted the question on him who put it : but I would not take that freedom .
And I was quite right : depend on that : there are a thousand reasons why liaisons between governesses and tutors should never be tolerated a moment in any well-regulated house ; firstly— " " Oh , gracious , mama !

Mrs. Fairfax had said Mr. Rochester possessed a fine voice : he did—a mellow , powerful bass , into which he threw his own feeling , his own force ; finding a way through the ear to the heart , and there waking sensation strangely .

I heard the dining-room door unclose ; a gentleman came out ; rising hastily , I stood face to face with him : it was Mr. Rochester .

It was verging on dusk , and the clock had already given warning of the hour to dress for dinner , when little Adele , who knelt by me in the drawing-room window-seat , suddenly exclaimed— " Voila , Monsieur Rochester , qui revient !
I no longer waited with interest for the curtain to rise ; my attention was absorbed by the spectators ; my eyes , erewhile fixed on the arch , were now irresistibly attracted to the semicircle of chairs .

I have seen in his face a far different expression from that which hardens it now while she is so vivaciously accosting him ; but then it came of itself : it was not elicited by meretricious arts and calculated manoeuvres ; and one had but to accept it—to answer what he asked without pretension , to address him when needful without grimace—and it increased and grew kinder and more genial , and warmed one like a fostering sunbeam .

The sarcasm that had repelled , the harshness that had startled me once , were only like keen condiments in a choice dish : their presence was pungent , but their absence would be felt as comparatively insipid .
Mild Mrs. Dent talked with good-natured Mrs. Eshton ; and the two sometimes bestowed a courteous word or smile on me .
Sometimes all , as with one consent , suspended their by-play to observe and listen to the principal actors : for , after all , Mr. Rochester and—because closely connected with him—Miss Ingram were the life and soul of the party .

The Ladies Lynn and Ingram continued to consort in solemn conferences , where they nodded their two turbans at each other , and held up their four hands in confronting gestures of surprise , or mystery , or horror , according to the theme on which their gossip ran , like a pair of magnified puppets .

" No , " I heard her say : " she looks too stupid for any game of the sort .
" Miss Ingram is mine , of course , " said he : afterwards he named the two Misses Eshton , and Mrs. Dent .
I mean what I say .

I have seen in his face a far different expression from that which hardens it now while she is so vivaciously accosting him ; but then it came of itself : it was not elicited by meretricious arts and calculated manoeuvres ; and one had but to accept it—to answer what he asked without pretension , to address him when needful without grimace—and it increased and grew kinder and more genial , and warmed one like a fostering sunbeam .
She was very showy , but she was not genuine : she had a fine person , many brilliant attainments ; but her mind was poor , her heart barren by nature : nothing bloomed spontaneously on that soil ; no unforced natural fruit delighted by its freshness .
But I was not jealous : or very rarely ; —the nature of the pain I suffered could not be explained by that word .
" Miss Ingram is mine , of course , " said he : afterwards he named the two Misses Eshton , and Mrs. Dent .
Blanche Ingram , after having repelled , by supercilious taciturnity , some efforts of Mrs. Dent and Mrs. Eshton to draw her into conversation , had first murmured over some sentimental tunes and airs on the piano , and then , having fetched a novel from the library , had flung herself in haughty listlessness on a sofa , and prepared to beguile , by the spell of fiction , the tedious hours of absence .

The room and the house were silent : only now and then the merriment of the billiard-players was heard from above .

" Do you know , " said she , " that , of the three characters , I liked you in the last best ?

I recall their interchanged glances ; and something even of the feeling roused by the spectacle returns in memory at this moment .
" asked Mrs. Eshton .
" And then , to my great relief , Mr. Henry Lynn summoned them to the other side of the room , to settle some point about the deferred excursion to Hay Common .
Other eyes besides mine watched these manifestations of character—watched them closely , keenly , shrewdly .
" And then , to my great relief , Mr. Henry Lynn summoned them to the other side of the room , to settle some point about the deferred excursion to Hay Common .
Mild Mrs. Dent talked with good-natured Mrs. Eshton ; and the two sometimes bestowed a courteous word or smile on me .
At first I could not make much sense of what I heard ; for the discourse of Louisa Eshton and Mary Ingram , who sat nearer to me , confused the fragmentary sentences that reached me at intervals .

" It appears I come at an inopportune time , madam , " said he , " when my friend , Mr. Rochester , is from home ; but I arrive from a very long journey , and I think I may presume so far on old and intimate acquaintance as to instal myself here till he returns .
It seemed to me that , were I a gentleman like him , I would take to my bosom only such a wife as I could love ; but the very obviousness of the advantages to the husband 's own happiness offered by this plan convinced me that there must be arguments against its general adoption of which I was quite ignorant : otherwise I felt sure all the world would act as I wished to act .

Excitement instantly seized the whole party : a running fire of raillery and jests was proceeding when Sam returned .

But I liked his physiognomy even less than before : it struck me as being at the same time unsettled and inanimate .
His features were regular , but too relaxed : his eye was large and well cut , but the life looking out of it was a tame , vacant life—at least so I thought .

" What did she say , sister ?
" As she said this , she approached her tall person and ample garments so near the window , that I was obliged to bend back almost to the breaking of my spine : in her eagerness she did not observe me at first , but when she did , she curled her lip and moved to another casement .
" She wishes to know who will be her first visitor .
I think ( with deference be it spoken ) the contrast could not be much greater between a sleek gander and a fierce falcon : between a meek sheep and the rough-coated keen-eyed dog , its guardian .
His eye wandered , and had no meaning in its wandering : this gave him an odd look , such as I never remembered to have seen .

" I asked myself .
" And what a sweet-tempered forehead he has !
" " I have ; and a quick eye and a quick brain .
" " You need them all in your trade .
" " I do ; especially when I 've customers like you to deal with .
Why don 't you tremble ?

" " Why don 't you consult my art ?
" " I 'm not silly .
" The old crone " nichered " a laugh under her bonnet and bandage ; she then drew out a short black pipe , and lighting it began to smoke .
Having indulged a while in this sedative , she raised her bent body , took the pipe from her lips , and while gazing steadily at the fire , said very deliberately— " You are cold ; you are sick ; and you are silly .
" " Prove it , " I rejoined .
" I will , in few words .
You are cold , because you are alone : no contact strikes the fire from you that is in you .
You are sick ; because the best of feelings , the highest and the sweetest given to man , keeps far away from you .
You are silly , because , suffer as you may , you will not beckon it to approach , nor will you stir one step to meet it where it waits you .
" She again put her short black pipe to her lips , and renewed her smoking with vigour .
" You might say all that to almost any one who you knew lived as a solitary dependent in a great house .
" " I might say it to almost any one : but would it be true of almost any one ?
" " In my circumstances .
" " Yes ; just so , in _ your _ circumstances : but find me another precisely placed as you are .
" " It would be easy to find you thousands .
" " You could scarcely find me one .
If you knew it , you are peculiarly situated : very near happiness ; yes , within reach of it .
The materials are all prepared ; there only wants a movement to combine them .

I watched her for nearly half-an-hour : during all that time she never turned a page , and her face grew momently darker , more dissatisfied , and more sourly expressive of disappointment .

" she said , in a voice as decided as her glance , as harsh as her features .
" I wonder what thoughts are busy in your heart during all the hours you sit in yonder room with the fine people flitting before you like shapes in a magic-lantern : just as little sympathetic communion passing between you and them as if they were really mere shadows of human forms , and not the actual substance .

At a late hour , after I had been in bed some time , I heard the visitors repair to their chambers : I distinguished Mr. Rochester 's voice , and heard him say , " This way , Mason ; this is your room .
" " Wonder and self-congratulation , sir .
" " Yes ; and to the beautiful Miss Ingram .
" My little friend !
" " No ; stay a moment ; and tell me what the people in the drawing-room yonder are doing .
" He staggered .
Again I looked at the face ; which was no longer turned from me—on the contrary , the bonnet was doffed , the bandage displaced , the head advanced .
It was a comfort ; but , indeed , I had been on my guard almost from the beginning of the interview .

The old woman 's voice had changed : her accent , her gesture , and all were familiar to me as my own face in a glass—as the speech of my own tongue .
Did I wake or sleep ?
" " I had better not stay long , sir ; it must be near eleven o 'clock .
" Where was I ?
" Mr. Rochester was standing near me ; he had taken my hand , as if to lead me to a chair .
" " Can I help you , sir ?
" I inquired .
" Where was I ?
" asked the familiar voice .
" " Break it , sir .
" " And Mason ?
" said she .
" " But well carried out , eh ?
" I knelt .
" Mr. Rochester was standing near me ; he had taken my hand , as if to lead me to a chair .
" " But not with you ?
" Where was I ?
But my mind had been running on Grace Poole—that living enigma , that mystery of mysteries , as I considered her .
It came out of the third storey ; for it passed overhead .
I have formed my plans—right plans I deem them—and in them I have attended to the claims of conscience , the counsels of reason .
" " But not with you ?
" asked the familiar voice .
" " Break it , sir .
" " But not with you ?

" I reflected , and thought , on the whole , I had .

" Where was I ?
" Mr. Rochester was standing near me ; he had taken my hand , as if to lead me to a chair .
" I knelt .
" said she .
" A chamber-door opened : some one ran , or rushed , along the gallery .
I filled a wine-glass ( I saw Miss Ingram watch me frowningly as I did so : she thought I was taking a liberty , I daresay ) , and I returned to the library .
" And dangerous he looked : his black eyes darted sparks .
I told her something on that point about an hour ago which made her look wondrous grave : the corners of her mouth fell half an inch .
" A chamber-door opened : some one ran , or rushed , along the gallery .
No : stillness returned : each murmur and movement ceased gradually , and in about an hour Thornfield Hall was again as hushed as a desert .
" Mr. Rochester was standing near me ; he had taken my hand , as if to lead me to a chair .

" My little friend !
" Where was I ?
Again I looked at the face ; which was no longer turned from me—on the contrary , the bonnet was doffed , the bandage displaced , the head advanced .
' " And Mr. Rochester stepped out of his disguise .
" " His name is Mason , sir ; and he comes from the West Indies ; from Spanish Town , in Jamaica , I think .
Again I looked at the face ; which was no longer turned from me—on the contrary , the bonnet was doffed , the bandage displaced , the head advanced .

" What awful event has taken place ?

" Now , sir , what a strange idea !

" " Sit down !
I filled a wine-glass ( I saw Miss Ingram watch me frowningly as I did so : she thought I was taking a liberty , I daresay ) , and I returned to the library .
" " Can I help you , sir ?
" He staggered .
" Are you up ?

At a late hour , after I had been in bed some time , I heard the visitors repair to their chambers : I distinguished Mr. Rochester 's voice , and heard him say , " This way , Mason ; this is your room .

As I spoke he gave my wrist a convulsive grip ; the smile on his lips froze : apparently a spasm caught his breath .

The cry died , and was not renewed .

This door was open ; a light shone out of the room within : I heard thence a snarling , snatching sound , almost like a dog quarrelling .
" Warm and steady , " was his remark : he turned the key and opened the door .
" " But not with you ?
' " And Mr. Rochester stepped out of his disguise .
" I returned , sought the sponge on the washstand , the salts in my drawer , and once more retraced my steps .
" " Can I help you , sir ?
" " Sit down !
Not , however , to go to bed : on the contrary , I began and dressed myself carefully .
" Speak ! let us know the worst at once !
Mr. Rochester stood in the gallery holding a light .
" Where was I ?
" I asked .
' " And Mr. Rochester stepped out of his disguise .
" Now , sir , what a strange idea !

" " But not with you ?

Calming himself by an effort , he added— " A servant has had the nightmare ; that is all .

" And the door at the end of the gallery opened , and Mr. Rochester advanced with a candle : he had just descended from the upper storey .
" " Here ! here !
An easy-chair was near the bed-head : a man sat in it , dressed with the exception of his coat ; he was still ; his head leant back ; his eyes were closed .
" I cannot find him in his bed .
" And dangerous he looked : his black eyes darted sparks .
" murmured Mr. Mason .
Mr. Rochester stood in the gallery holding a light .
" Again the poor man groaned ; he looked as if he dared not move ; fear , either of death or of something else , appeared almost to paralyse him .
No—a mere scratch .
" Am I wanted ?
" I cannot find him in his bed .

It could not have lasted more than two hours : many a week has seemed shorter .
Oh !
" Now , Carter , be on the alert , " he said to this last : " I give you but half-an-hour for dressing the wound , fastening the bandages , getting the patient downstairs and all .
" But under such circumstances , what could one do ?
I left the window , and moved with little noise across the carpet ; as I stooped to take off my shoes , a cautious hand tapped low at the door .
" " Go back and fetch both .
" Oh , it was frightful !
" I returned , sought the sponge on the washstand , the salts in my drawer , and once more retraced my steps .

" Yes , sir .
" " Go back and fetch both .
" " I shall have to leave you in this room with this gentleman , for an hour , or perhaps two hours : you will sponge the blood as I do when it returns : if he feels faint , you will put the glass of water on that stand to his lips , and your salts to his nose .

Jane " ( he turned to me for the first time since his re-entrance ) , " take this key : go down into my bedroom , and walk straight forward into my dressing-room : open the top drawer of the wardrobe and take out a clean shirt and neck-handkerchief : bring them here ; and be nimble .
" he said ; and I walked round to the other side of a large bed , which with its drawn curtains concealed a considerable portion of the chamber .
" Now , " said he , " go to the other side of the bed while I order his toilet ; but don 't leave the room : you may be wanted again .
" Here , Jane !

" I put my fingers into his .
" said she .
" he added , shuddering .
Here , Carter , help him on with his waist-coat .
I saw Mr. Rochester shudder : a singularly marked expression of disgust , horror , hatred , warped his countenance almost to distortion ; but he only said— " Come , be silent , Richard , and never mind her gibberish : don 't repeat it .
" " You thought ! you thought !
" murmured Mr. Mason .
" I asked .

Yes , it makes me impatient to hear you : but , however , you have suffered , and are likely to suffer enough for not taking my advice ; so I 'll say no more .

The stillness of early morning slumbered everywhere ; the curtains were yet drawn over the servants ' chamber windows ; little birds were just twittering in the blossom-blanched orchard trees , whose boughs drooped like white garlands over the wall enclosing one side of the yard ; the carriage horses stamped from time to time in their closed stables : all else was still .

It is not a thing to be used indiscriminately , but it is good upon occasion : as now , for instance .
" And I did not expect it : she looked so quiet at first .
" It was by this time half-past five , and the sun was on the point of rising ; but I found the kitchen still dark and silent .
" " You thought ! you thought !
_ She _ then was there .
Mason will not defy me ; nor , knowing it , will he hurt me—but , unintentionally , he might in a moment , by one careless word , deprive me , if not of life , yet for ever of happiness .
" You will when you are out of the country : when you get back to Spanish Town , you may think of her as dead and buried—or rather , you need not think of her at all .
—Carter has done with you or nearly so ;
He was dressed now : he still looked pale , but he was no longer gory and sullied .

" " I do feel better , " remarked Mr. Mason .

Jane , when will you watch with me again ?

" " For instance , the night before I am married !
I am sure I shall not be able to sleep .
Will you promise to sit up with me to bear me company ?
To you I can talk of my lovely one : for now you have seen her and know her .
" " Yes , sir .
" " She 's a rare one , is she not , Jane ?
" " Yes , sir .
" " A strapper—a real strapper , Jane : big , brown , and buxom ; with hair just such as the ladies of Carthage must have had .
Bless me ! there 's Dent and Lynn in the stables !
Go in by the shrubbery , through that wicket .
" As I went one way , he went another , and I heard him in the yard , saying cheerfully— " Mason got the start of you all this morning ; he was gone before sunrise : I rose at four to see him off .
Presentiments are strange things ! and so are sympathies ; and so are signs ; and the three combined make one mystery to which humanity has not yet found the key .
I never laughed at presentiments in my life , because I have had strange ones of my own .
Sympathies , I believe , exist ( for instance , between far-distant , long-absent , wholly estranged relatives asserting , notwithstanding their alienation , the unity of the source to which each traces his origin ) whose workings baffle mortal comprehension .
And signs , for aught we know , may be but the sympathies of Nature with man .
When I was a little girl , only six years old , I one night heard Bessie Leaven say to Martha Abbot that she had been dreaming about a little child ; and that to dream of children was a sure sign of trouble , either to one 's self or one 's kin .
The saying might have worn out of my memory , had not a circumstance immediately followed which served indelibly to fix it there .
The next day Bessie was sent for home to the deathbed of her little sister .
Of late I had often recalled this saying and this incident ; for during the past week scarcely a night had gone over my couch that had not brought with it a dream of an infant , which I sometimes hushed in my arms , sometimes dandled on my knee , sometimes watched playing with daisies on a lawn , or again , dabbling its hands in running water .
It was a wailing child this night , and a laughing one the next : now it nestled close to me , and now it ran from me ; but whatever mood the apparition evinced , whatever aspect it wore , it failed not for seven successive nights to meet me the moment I entered the land of slumber .
I did not like this iteration of one idea—this strange recurrence of one image , and I grew nervous as bedtime approached and the hour of the vision drew near .
It was from companionship with this baby-phantom I had been roused on that moonlight night when I heard the cry ; and it was on the afternoon of the day following I was summoned downstairs by a message that some one wanted me in Mrs. Fairfax 's room .
On repairing thither , I found a man waiting for me , having the appearance of a gentleman 's servant : he was dressed in deep mourning , and the hat he held in his hand was surrounded with a crape band .
" I daresay you hardly remember me , Miss , " he said , rising as I entered ; " but my name is Leaven : I lived coachman with Mrs. Reed when you were at Gateshead , eight or nine years since , and I live there still .
" " Oh , Robert ! how do you do ?
I remember you very well : you used to give me a ride sometimes on Miss Georgiana 's bay pony .
And how is Bessie ?
You are married to Bessie ?
" " Yes , Miss : my wife is very hearty , thank you ; she brought me another little one about two months since—we have three now—and both mother and child are thriving .
" " And are the family well at the house , Robert ?
" " I am sorry I can 't give you better news of them , Miss : they are very badly at present—in great trouble .
" " I hope no one is dead , " I said , glancing at his black dress .
He too looked down at the crape round his hat and replied— " Mr. John died yesterday was a week , at his chambers in London .
" " Mr. John ?
" " Yes .
" " And how does his mother bear it ?
" " Why , you see , Miss Eyre , it is not a common mishap : his life has been very wild : these last three years he gave himself up to strange ways , and his death was shocking .
" " I heard from Bessie he was not doing well .
" " Doing well !
He could not do worse : he ruined his health and his estate amongst the worst men and the worst women .
He got into debt and into jail : his mother helped him out twice , but as soon as he was free he returned to his old companions and habits .
His head was not strong : the knaves he lived amongst fooled him beyond anything I ever heard .
He came down to Gateshead about three weeks ago and wanted missis to give up all to him .
Missis refused : her means have long been much reduced by his extravagance ; so he went back again , and the next news was that he was dead .
How he died , God knows ! —they say he killed himself .
" I was silent : the things were frightful .
Robert Leaven resumed— " Missis had been out of health herself for some time : she had got very stout , but was not strong with it ; and the loss of money and fear of poverty were quite breaking her down .
The information about Mr. John 's death and the manner of it came too suddenly : it brought on a stroke .
She was three days without speaking ; but last Tuesday she seemed rather better : she appeared as if she wanted to say something , and kept making signs to my wife and mumbling .
" As I went one way , he went another , and I heard him in the yard , saying cheerfully— " Mason got the start of you all this morning ; he was gone before sunrise : I rose at four to see him off .
" but my name is Leaven : I lived coachman with Mrs. Reed when you were at Gateshead , eight or nine years since , and I live there still .
Is that wrong , Jane ?
Is that wrong , Jane ?
Jane , when will you watch with me again ?
He came down to Gateshead about three weeks ago and wanted missis to give up all to him .
" " Oh , Robert ! how do you do ?
I am sure I shall not be able to sleep .
" " Yes , sir .
" " I heard from Bessie he was not doing well .
You are married to Bessie ?
" " Yes .
" He paused for an answer : and what was I to say ?
" but my name is Leaven : I lived coachman with Mrs. Reed when you were at Gateshead , eight or nine years since , and I live there still .
No , sir .
" Little friend , " said he , in quite a changed tone—while his face changed too , losing all its softness and gravity , and becoming harsh and sarcastic— " you have noticed my tender penchant for Miss Ingram : don 't you think if I married her she would regenerate me with a vengeance ?
" He paused for an answer : and what was I to say ?
I did not like this iteration of one idea—this strange recurrence of one image , and I grew nervous as bedtime approached and the hour of the vision drew near .
" Little friend , " said he , in quite a changed tone—while his face changed too , losing all its softness and gravity , and becoming harsh and sarcastic— " you have noticed my tender penchant for Miss Ingram : don 't you think if I married her she would regenerate me with a vengeance ?

" The arbour was an arch in the wall , lined with ivy ; it contained a rustic seat .
" He got up instantly , went quite to the other end of the walk , and when he came back he was humming a tune .
" " Curse you ?
Again Mr. Rochester propounded his query : " Is the wandering and sinful , but now rest-seeking and repentant , man justified in daring the world 's opinion , in order to attach to him for ever this gentle , gracious , genial stranger , thereby securing his own peace of mind and regeneration of life ?

Is that wrong , Jane ?
" He paused for an answer : and what was I to say ?
" " Yes , Miss : my wife is very hearty , thank you ; she brought me another little one about two months since—we have three now—and both mother and child are thriving .
" " Curse you ?
" " Mr. John ?
" " I like to serve you , sir , and to obey you in all that is right .
" " Curse you ?
You are married to Bessie ?
" " Yes , sir .
" " Curse you ?
What cold fingers !
Jane , when will you watch with me again ?
" but my name is Leaven : I lived coachman with Mrs. Reed when you were at Gateshead , eight or nine years since , and I live there still .

" " Doing well !
Is that wrong , Jane ?
Jane , when will you watch with me again ?
Sympathies , I believe , exist ( for instance , between far-distant , long-absent , wholly estranged relatives asserting , notwithstanding their alienation , the unity of the source to which each traces his origin ) whose workings baffle mortal comprehension .
No , sir .
" but my name is Leaven : I lived coachman with Mrs. Reed when you were at Gateshead , eight or nine years since , and I live there still .
" " Curse you ?
" I was silent : the things were frightful .
He made a curious grimace—one of his strange and equivocal demonstrations—threw down his cue and followed me from the room .
" but my name is Leaven : I lived coachman with Mrs. Reed when you were at Gateshead , eight or nine years since , and I live there still .
" " And are the family well at the house , Robert ?
" but my name is Leaven : I lived coachman with Mrs. Reed when you were at Gateshead , eight or nine years since , and I live there still .
" " And are the family well at the house , Robert ?
How he died , God knows ! —they say he killed himself .
The information about Mr. John 's death and the manner of it came too suddenly : it brought on a stroke .
" " And what have you to do with her ?
Is that wrong , Jane ?
That is a hundred miles off !
You never told me that before : you always said you had no relations .
" " Yes , sir .
" I was silent : the things were frightful .
The saying might have worn out of my memory , had not a circumstance immediately followed which served indelibly to fix it there .
" " What to do ? —where to go ?
" " Whenever I can be useful , sir .
" If you please , sir , I want leave of absence for a week or two .
" " Yes ; and I will do it now ;
Will you promise to sit up with me to bear me company ?
" " No , sir ;
" He got up instantly , went quite to the other end of the walk , and when he came back he was humming a tune .
" " And what have you to do with her ?
That is a hundred miles off !
No , sir .
" Does that person want you ?
" but my name is Leaven : I lived coachman with Mrs. Reed when you were at Gateshead , eight or nine years since , and I live there still .
" she inquired of Mr. Rochester ; and Mr. Rochester turned to see who the " person " was .
" " And who goes with you ?
" " As short a time as possible , sir .
" " Yes .
" Does that person want you ?
" " Well , you must have some money ; you can 't travel without money , and I daresay you have not much : I have given you no salary yet .
" " Well , you must have some money ; you can 't travel without money , and I daresay you have not much : I have given you no salary yet .
How much have you in the world , Jane ?
" he asked , smiling .
I drew out my purse ; a meagre thing it was .
" Five shillings , sir .
" He took the purse , poured the hoard into his palm , and chuckled over it as if its scantiness amused him .
Soon he produced his pocket-book : " Here , " said he , offering me a note ; it was fifty pounds , and he owed me but fifteen .
I told him I had no change .
" I don 't want change ; you know that .
Take your wages .
" I declined accepting more than was my due .
He scowled at first ; then , as if recollecting something , he said— " Right , right !
Better not give you all now : you would , perhaps , stay away three months if you had fifty pounds .
There are ten ; is it not plenty ?
" " Yes , sir , but now you owe me five .
" " Come back for it , then ;
I am your banker for forty pounds .
" " Mr. Rochester , I may as well mention another matter of business to you while I have the opportunity .
" " Matter of business ?
I am curious to hear it .
" " You have as good as informed me , sir , that you are going shortly to be married ?
" " Yes ; what then ?
" " In that case , sir , Adele ought to go to school : I am sure you will perceive the necessity of it .
" " To get her out of my bride 's way , who might otherwise walk over her rather too emphatically ?
There 's sense in the suggestion ; not a doubt of it .
Adele , as you say , must go to school ; and you , of course , must march straight to—the devil ?
" " I hope not , sir ; but I must seek another situation somewhere .
" " In course !
" he exclaimed , with a twang of voice and a distortion of features equally fantastic and ludicrous .
He looked at me some minutes .
" And old Madam Reed , or the Misses , her daughters , will be solicited by you to seek a place , I suppose ?
" " No , sir ;
I am not on such terms with my relatives as would justify me in asking favours of them—but I shall advertise .
" " You shall walk up the pyramids of Egypt !
" he growled .
" At your peril you advertise !
I wish I had only offered you a sovereign instead of ten pounds .
Give me back nine pounds , Jane ;
I 've a use for it .
" " And so have I , sir , " I returned , putting my hands and my purse behind me .
" I could not spare the money on any account .
" " Little niggard !
" said he , " refusing me a pecuniary request !
Give me five pounds , Jane .
" " Not five shillings , sir ; nor five pence .
" " Just let me look at the cash .
" " No , sir ; you are not to be trusted .
" " Jane !
" " Sir ?
" " Promise me one thing .
" " I 'll promise you anything , sir , that I think I am likely to perform .
" " Not to advertise : and to trust this quest of a situation to me .
I 'll find you one in time .
" " I shall be glad so to do , sir , if you , in your turn , will promise that I and Adele shall be both safe out of the house before your bride enters it .
" " Very well ! very well !
I 'll pledge my word on it .
You go to-morrow , then ?
" " Yes , sir ; early .
" " Shall you come down to the drawing-room after dinner ?
" " No , sir , I must prepare for the journey .
" " Then you and I must bid good-bye for a little while ?
" " I suppose so , sir .
" " And how do people perform that ceremony of parting , Jane ?
Teach me ;
I 'm not quite up to it .
" " They say , Farewell , or any other form they prefer .
" " Then say it .
" " Farewell , Mr. Rochester , for the present .
" " What must I say ?
" " The same , if you like , sir .
" " Farewell , Miss Eyre , for the present ; is that all ?
" " Yes ?
" " It seems stingy , to my notions , and dry , and unfriendly .
I should like something else : a little addition to the rite .
If one shook hands , for instance ; but no—that would not content me either .
So you 'll do no more than say Farewell , Jane ?
" " It is enough , sir : as much good-will may be conveyed in one hearty word as in many .
" " Very likely ; but it is blank and cool— ' Farewell .
' " " How long is he going to stand with his back against that door ?
" I asked myself ; " I want to commence my packing .
" The dinner-bell rang , and suddenly away he bolted , without another syllable : I saw him no more during the day , and was off before he had risen in the morning .
I reached the lodge at Gateshead about five o 'clock in the afternoon of the first of May : I stepped in there before going up to the hall .
It was very clean and neat : the ornamental windows were hung with little white curtains ; the floor was spotless ; the grate and fire-irons were burnished bright , and the fire burnt clear .
Bessie sat on the hearth , nursing her last-born , and Robert and his sister played quietly in a corner .
" Bless you ! —I knew you would come !
" exclaimed Mrs. Leaven , as I entered .
" Yes , Bessie , " said I , after I had kissed her ; " and I trust I am not too late .
How is Mrs. Reed ?
—Alive still , I hope .
" " Yes , she is alive ; and more sensible and collected than she was .
The doctor says she may linger a week or two yet ; but he hardly thinks she will finally recover .
" " Has she mentioned me lately ?
" " She was talking of you only this morning , and wishing you would come , but she is sleeping now , or was ten minutes ago , when I was up at the house .
She generally lies in a kind of lethargy all the afternoon , and wakes up about six or seven .
Will you rest yourself here an hour , Miss , and then I will go up with you ?
" Robert here entered , and Bessie laid her sleeping child in the cradle and went to welcome him : afterwards she insisted on my taking off my bonnet and having some tea ; for she said I looked pale and tired .
I was glad to accept her hospitality ; and I submitted to be relieved of my travelling garb just as passively as I used to let her undress me when a child .
Old times crowded fast back on me as I watched her bustling about—setting out the tea-tray with her best china , cutting bread and butter , toasting a tea-cake , and , between whiles , giving little Robert or Jane an occasional tap or push , just as she used to give me in former days .
Bessie had retained her quick temper as well as her light foot and good looks .
Tea ready , I was going to approach the table ; but she desired me to sit still , quite in her old peremptory tones .
I must be served at the fireside , she said ; and she placed before me a little round stand with my cup and a plate of toast , absolutely as she used to accommodate me with some privately purloined dainty on a nursery chair : and I smiled and obeyed her as in bygone days .
" Yes , Bessie , " said I , after I had kissed her ;
She wanted to know if I was happy at Thornfield Hall , and what sort of a person the mistress was ; and when I told her there was only a master , whether he was a nice gentleman , and if I liked him .
" I asked myself ;
" " I 'll promise you anything , sir , that I think I am likely to perform .
" " Yes ; what then ?
He looked at me some minutes .
" " And so have I , sir , " I returned , putting my hands and my purse behind me .
" Yes , Bessie , " said I , after I had kissed her ;
—I knew you would come !
" " And so have I , sir , " I returned , putting my hands and my purse behind me .
—Alive still , I hope .
" and I trust I am not too late .
It was very clean and neat : the ornamental windows were hung with little white curtains ; the floor was spotless ; the grate and fire-irons were burnished bright , and the fire burnt clear .

I told her he was rather an ugly man , but quite a gentleman ; and that he treated me kindly , and I was content .

It was also accompanied by her that I had , nearly nine years ago , walked down the path I was now ascending .

He looked at me some minutes .
Two young ladies appeared before me ; one very tall , almost as tall as Miss Ingram—very thin too , with a sallow face and severe mien .
On a dark , misty , raw morning in January , I had left a hostile roof with a desperate and embittered heart—a sense of outlawry and almost of reprobation—to seek the chilly harbourage of Lowood : that bourne so far away and unexplored .
This I felt sure was Eliza , though I could trace little resemblance to her former self in that elongated and colourless visage .
The hue of her dress was black too ; but its fashion was so different from her sister 's—so much more flowing and becoming—it looked as stylish as the other 's looked puritanical .
" I could not spare the money on any account .
" In another moment I was within that apartment .
On a dark , misty , raw morning in January , I had left a hostile roof with a desperate and embittered heart—a sense of outlawry and almost of reprobation—to seek the chilly harbourage of Lowood : that bourne so far away and unexplored .
How is Mrs. Reed ?
" I asked myself ;
" How is Mrs. Reed ?
" " Jane !
—I knew you would come !
Ah ! mama , you mean ; she is extremely poorly : I doubt if you can see her to-night .
Ah ! mama , you mean ; she is extremely poorly : I doubt if you can see her to-night .
" " If , " said I , " you would just step upstairs and tell her I am come , I should be much obliged to you .
" Georgiana almost started , and she opened her blue eyes wild and wide .
" I know she had a particular wish to see me , " I added , " and I would not defer attending to her desire longer than is absolutely necessary .
" " Mama dislikes being disturbed in an evening , " remarked Eliza .
I soon rose , quietly took off my bonnet and gloves , uninvited , and said I would just step out to Bessie—who was , I dared say , in the kitchen—and ask her to ascertain whether Mrs. Reed was disposed to receive me or not to- night .
I went , and having found Bessie and despatched her on my errand , I proceeded to take further measures .
It had heretofore been my habit always to shrink from arrogance : received as I had been to-day , I should , a year ago , have resolved to quit Gateshead the very next morning ; now , it was disclosed to me all at once that that would be a foolish plan .
I had taken a journey of a hundred miles to see my aunt , and I must stay with her till she was better—or dead : as to her daughters ' pride or folly , I must put it on one side , make myself independent of it .
So I addressed the housekeeper ; asked her to show me a room , told her I should probably be a visitor here for a week or two , had my trunk conveyed to my chamber , and followed it thither myself : I met Bessie on the landing .
" Missis is awake , " said she ;
" I have told her you are here : come and let us see if she will know you .
" I did not need to be guided to the well-known room , to which I had so often been summoned for chastisement or reprimand in former days .
I hastened before Bessie ;
I softly opened the door : a shaded light stood on the table , for it was now getting dark .
There was the great four-post bed with amber hangings as of old ; there the toilet-table , the armchair , and the footstool , at which I had a hundred times been sentenced to kneel , to ask pardon for offences by me uncommitted .
I looked into a certain corner near , half-expecting to see the slim outline of a once dreaded switch which used to lurk there , waiting to leap out imp-like and lace my quivering palm or shrinking neck .
I approached the bed ;
I opened the curtains and leant over the high-piled pillows .
Well did I remember Mrs. Reed 's face , and I eagerly sought the familiar image .
It is a happy thing that time quells the longings of vengeance and hushes the promptings of rage and aversion . I had left this woman in bitterness and hate , and I came back to her now with no other emotion than a sort of ruth for her great sufferings , and a strong yearning to forget and forgive all injuries—to be reconciled and clasp hands in amity .
The well-known face was there : stern , relentless as ever—there was that peculiar eye which nothing could melt , and the somewhat raised , imperious , despotic eyebrow .
How often had it lowered on me menace and hate ! and how the recollection of childhood 's terrors and sorrows revived as I traced its harsh line now !
And yet I stooped down and kissed her : she looked at me .
" Is this Jane Eyre ?
" she said .
" Yes , Aunt Reed .
How are you , dear aunt ?
" I had once vowed that I would never call her aunt again : I thought it no sin to forget and break that vow now .
My fingers had fastened on her hand which lay outside the sheet : had she pressed mine kindly , I should at that moment have experienced true pleasure .
But unimpressionable natures are not so soon softened , nor are natural antipathies so readily eradicated . Mrs. Reed took her hand away , and , turning her face rather from me , she remarked that the night was warm .
Again she regarded me so icily , I felt at once that her opinion of me—her feeling towards me—was unchanged and unchangeable .
I knew by her stony eye—opaque to tenderness , indissoluble to tears—that she was resolved to consider me bad to the last ; because to believe me good would give her no generous pleasure : only a sense of mortification .
I felt pain , and then I felt ire ; and then I felt a determination to subdue her—to be her mistress in spite both of her nature and her will .
My tears had risen , just as in childhood : I ordered them back to their source .
I brought a chair to the bed-head : I sat down and leaned over the pillow .
" You sent for me , " I said , " and I am here ; and it is my intention to stay till I see how you get on .
" " Oh , of course !
You have seen my daughters ?
" " Yes .
" " Well , you may tell them I wish you to stay till I can talk some things over with you I have on my mind : to-night it is too late , and I have a difficulty in recalling them .
But there was something I wished to say—let me see— " The wandering look and changed utterance told what wreck had taken place in her once vigorous frame .
Turning restlessly , she drew the bedclothes round her ; my elbow , resting on a corner of the quilt , fixed it down : she was at once irritated .
" Sit up !
" said she ;
" don 't annoy me with holding the clothes fast .
Are you Jane Eyre ?
" " I am Jane Eyre .
" " I have had more trouble with that child than any one would believe .
Such a burden to be left on my hands—and so much annoyance as she caused me , daily and hourly , with her incomprehensible disposition , and her sudden starts of temper , and her continual , unnatural watchings of one 's movements !
I declare she talked to me once like something mad , or like a fiend—no child ever spoke or looked as she did ;
I was glad to get her away from the house .
What did they do with her at Lowood ?
The fever broke out there , and many of the pupils died .
She , however , did not die : but I said she did—I wish she had died !
" " A strange wish , Mrs. Reed ; why do you hate her so ?
" " I had a dislike to her mother always ; for she was my husband 's only sister , and a great favourite with him : he opposed the family 's disowning her when she made her low marriage ; and when news came of her death , he wept like a simpleton .
He would send for the baby ; though I entreated him rather to put it out to nurse and pay for its maintenance .
I hated it the first time I set my eyes on it—a sickly , whining , pining thing !
It would wail in its cradle all night long—not screaming heartily like any other child , but whimpering and moaning .
Reed pitied it ; and he used to nurse it and notice it as if it had been his own : more , indeed , than he ever noticed his own at that age .
He would try to make my children friendly to the little beggar : the darlings could not bear it , and he was angry with them when they showed their dislike .
In his last illness , he had it brought continually to his bedside ; and but an hour before he died , he bound me by vow to keep the creature .
I would as soon have been charged with a pauper brat out of a workhouse : but he was weak , naturally weak .
John does not at all resemble his father , and I am glad of it : John is like me and like my brothers—he is quite a Gibson .
Oh , I wish he would cease tormenting me with letters for money ?
I have no more money to give him : we are getting poor .
I must send away half the servants and shut up part of the house ; or let it off .
I can never submit to do that—yet how are we to get on ?
Two-thirds of my income goes in paying the interest of mortgages .
John gambles dreadfully , and always loses—poor boy !
He is beset by sharpers : John is sunk and degraded—his look is frightful—I feel ashamed for him when I see him .
" She was getting much excited .
" I think I had better leave her now , " said I to Bessie , who stood on the other side of the bed .
" Perhaps you had , Miss : but she often talks in this way towards night—in the morning she is calmer .
" I rose .
" Stop !
" exclaimed Mrs. Reed , " there is another thing I wished to say .
He threatens me—he continually threatens me with his own death , or mine : and I dream sometimes that I see him laid out with a great wound in his throat , or with a swollen and blackened face .
I am come to a strange pass : I have heavy troubles .
What is to be done ?
How is the money to be had ?
" Bessie now endeavoured to persuade her to take a sedative draught : she succeeded with difficulty .
Soon after , Mrs. Reed grew more composed , and sank into a dozing state .
I then left her .
More than ten days elapsed before I had again any conversation with her .
She continued either delirious or lethargic ; and the doctor forbade everything which could painfully excite her .
Meantime , I got on as well as I could with Georgiana and Eliza .
They were very cold , indeed , at first .
Eliza would sit half the day sewing , reading , or writing , and scarcely utter a word either to me or her sister .
Georgiana would chatter nonsense to her canary bird by the hour , and take no notice of me .
But I was determined not to seem at a loss for occupation or amusement : I had brought my drawing materials with me , and they served me for both .
Provided with a case of pencils , and some sheets of paper , I used to take a seat apart from them , near the window , and busy myself in sketching fancy vignettes , representing any scene that happened momentarily to shape itself in the ever-shifting kaleidoscope of imagination : a glimpse of sea between two rocks ; the rising moon , and a ship crossing its disk ; a group of reeds and water-flags , and a naiad 's head , crowned with lotus- flowers , rising out of them ; an elf sitting in a hedge-sparrow 's nest , under a wreath of hawthorn-bloom .
One morning I fell to sketching a face : what sort of a face it was to be , I did not care or know .
I took a soft black pencil , gave it a broad point , and worked away .
Soon I had traced on the paper a broad and prominent forehead and a square lower outline of visage : that contour gave me pleasure ; my fingers proceeded actively to fill it with features .
Strongly-marked horizontal eyebrows must be traced under that brow ; then followed , naturally , a well-defined nose , with a straight ridge and full nostrils ; then a flexible-looking mouth , by no means narrow ; then a firm chin , with a decided cleft down the middle of it : of course , some black whiskers were wanted , and some jetty hair , tufted on the temples , and waved above the forehead .
Now for the eyes : I had left them to the last , because they required the most careful working .
I drew them large ;
I shaped them well : the eyelashes I traced long and sombre ; the irids lustrous and large .
" Good ! but not quite the thing , " I thought , as I surveyed the effect : " they want more force and spirit ;
" and I wrought the shades blacker , that the lights might flash more brilliantly—a happy touch or two secured success .
There , I had a friend 's face under my gaze ; and what did it signify that those young ladies turned their backs on me ?
I looked at it ;
I smiled at the speaking likeness : I was absorbed and content .
" Is that a portrait of some one you know ?
" asked Eliza , who had approached me unnoticed .
I responded that it was merely a fancy head , and hurried it beneath the other sheets .
Of course , I lied : it was , in fact , a very faithful representation of Mr. Rochester .
But what was that to her , or to any one but myself ?
Georgiana also advanced to look .
The other drawings pleased her much , but she called that " an ugly man .
" They both seemed surprised at my skill .
I offered to sketch their portraits ; and each , in turn , sat for a pencil outline .
Then Georgiana produced her album .
I promised to contribute a water-colour drawing : this put her at once into good humour .
She proposed a walk in the grounds .
Before we had been out two hours , we were deep in a confidential conversation : she had favoured me with a description of the brilliant winter she had spent in London two seasons ago—of the admiration she had there excited—the attention she had received ; and I even got hints of the titled conquest she had made .
In the course of the afternoon and evening these hints were enlarged on : various soft conversations were reported , and sentimental scenes represented ; and , in short , a volume of a novel of fashionable life was that day improvised by her for my benefit .
The communications were renewed from day to day : they always ran on the same theme—herself , her loves , and woes .
It was strange she never once adverted either to her mother 's illness , or her brother 's death , or the present gloomy state of the family prospects .
Her mind seemed wholly taken up with reminiscences of past gaiety , and aspirations after dissipations to come .
She passed about five minutes each day in her mother 's sick-room , and no more .
Eliza still spoke little : she had evidently no time to talk .
I never saw a busier person than she seemed to be ; yet it was difficult to say what she did : or rather , to discover any result of her diligence .
She had an alarm to call her up early .
I know not how she occupied herself before breakfast , but after that meal she divided her time into regular portions , and each hour had its allotted task .
Three times a day she studied a little book , which I found , on inspection , was a Common Prayer Book .
I asked her once what was the great attraction of that volume , and she said , " the Rubric .
" Three hours she gave to stitching , with gold thread , the border of a square crimson cloth , almost large enough for a carpet .
In answer to my inquiries after the use of this article , she informed me it was a covering for the altar of a new church lately erected near Gateshead .
Two hours she devoted to her diary ; two to working by herself in the kitchen-garden ; and one to the regulation of her accounts .
But what was that to her , or to any one but myself ?
" " I had a dislike to her mother always ; for she was my husband 's only sister , and a great favourite with him : he opposed the family 's disowning her when she made her low marriage ; and when news came of her death , he wept like a simpleton .

It was strange she never once adverted either to her mother 's illness , or her brother 's death , or the present gloomy state of the family prospects .

They were very cold , indeed , at first .
But what was that to her , or to any one but myself ?
It was strange she never once adverted either to her mother 's illness , or her brother 's death , or the present gloomy state of the family prospects .
Then Georgiana produced her album .
" " I had a dislike to her mother always ; for she was my husband 's only sister , and a great favourite with him : he opposed the family 's disowning her when she made her low marriage ; and when news came of her death , he wept like a simpleton .
" I think I had better leave her now , " said I to Bessie , who stood on the other side of the bed .
It was strange she never once adverted either to her mother 's illness , or her brother 's death , or the present gloomy state of the family prospects .
It was strange she never once adverted either to her mother 's illness , or her brother 's death , or the present gloomy state of the family prospects .
Two hours she devoted to her diary ; two to working by herself in the kitchen-garden ; and one to the regulation of her accounts .
" " A strange wish , Mrs. Reed ; why do you hate her so ?
Georgiana and she had nothing in common : they never had had .
It would wail in its cradle all night long—not screaming heartily like any other child , but whimpering and moaning .
I hated it the first time I set my eyes on it—a sickly , whining , pining thing !
John gambles dreadfully , and always loses—poor boy !
Then , too , existence for you must be a scene of continual change and excitement , or else the world is a dungeon : you must be admired , you must be courted , you must be flattered—you must have music , dancing , and society—or you languish , you die away .
Have you no sense to devise a system which will make you independent of all efforts , and all wills , but your own ?
Take one day ; share it into sections ; to each section apportion its task : leave no stray unemployed quarters of an hour , ten minutes , five minutes—include all ; do each piece of business in its turn with method , with rigid regularity .
The day will close almost before you are aware it has begun ; and you are indebted to no one for helping you to get rid of one vacant moment : you have had to seek no one 's company , conversation , sympathy , forbearance ; you have lived , in short , as an independent being ought to do .
Take this advice : the first and last I shall offer you ; then you will not want me or any one else , happen what may .
Neglect it—go on as heretofore , craving , whining , and idling—and suffer the results of your idiocy , however bad and insuperable they may be .
I tell you this plainly ; and listen : for though I shall no more repeat what I am now about to say , I shall steadily act on it .
After my mother 's death , I wash my hands of you : from the day her coffin is carried to the vault in Gateshead Church , you and I will be as separate as if we had never known each other .
You need not think that because we chanced to be born of the same parents , I shall suffer you to fasten me down by even the feeblest claim : I can tell you this—if the whole human race , ourselves excepted , were swept away , and we two stood alone on the earth , I would leave you in the old world , and betake myself to the new .
" She closed her lips .
" You might have spared yourself the trouble of delivering that tirade , " answered Georgiana .
" Everybody knows you are the most selfish , heartless creature in existence : and _ I _ know your spiteful hatred towards me : I have had a specimen of it before in the trick you played me about Lord Edwin Vere : you could not bear me to be raised above you , to have a title , to be received into circles where you dare not show your face , and so you acted the spy and informer , and ruined my prospects for ever .
" Georgiana took out her handkerchief and blew her nose for an hour afterwards ;
Eliza sat cold , impassable , and assiduously industrious .
True , generous feeling is made small account of by some , but here were two natures rendered , the one intolerably acrid , the other despicably savourless for the want of it .
Feeling without judgment is a washy draught indeed ; but judgment untempered by feeling is too bitter and husky a morsel for human deglutition .
It was a wet and windy afternoon : Georgiana had fallen asleep on the sofa over the perusal of a novel ;
Eliza was gone to attend a saint 's-day service at the new church—for in matters of religion she was a rigid formalist : no weather ever prevented the punctual discharge of what she considered her devotional duties ; fair or foul , she went to church thrice every Sunday , and as often on week-days as there were prayers .
I bethought myself to go upstairs and see how the dying woman sped , who lay there almost unheeded : the very servants paid her but a remittent attention : the hired nurse , being little looked after , would slip out of the room whenever she could .
Bessie was faithful ; but she had her own family to mind , and could only come occasionally to the hall .
I found the sick-room unwatched , as I had expected : no nurse was there ; the patient lay still , and seemingly lethargic ; her livid face sunk in the pillows : the fire was dying in the grate .
I renewed the fuel , re-arranged the bedclothes , gazed awhile on her who could not now gaze on me , and then I moved away to the window .
The rain beat strongly against the panes , the wind blew tempestuously : " One lies there , " I thought , " who will soon be beyond the war of earthly elements .
Whither will that spirit—now struggling to quit its material tenement—flit when at length released ?
" In pondering the great mystery , I thought of Helen Burns , recalled her dying words—her faith—her doctrine of the equality of disembodied souls .
I was still listening in thought to her well-remembered tones—still picturing her pale and spiritual aspect , her wasted face and sublime gaze , as she lay on her placid deathbed , and whispered her longing to be restored to her divine Father 's bosom—when a feeble voice murmured from the couch behind : " Who is that ?
" I knew Mrs. Reed had not spoken for days : was she reviving ?
I went up to her .
" It is I , Aunt Reed .
" " Who—I ?
" was her answer .
" Who are you ?
" looking at me with surprise and a sort of alarm , but still not wildly .
" You are quite a stranger to me—where is Bessie ?
" " She is at the lodge , aunt .
" " Aunt , " she repeated .
" Who calls me aunt ?
You are not one of the Gibsons ; and yet I know you—that face , and the eyes and forehead , are quiet familiar to me : you are like—why , you are like Jane Eyre !
" I said nothing : I was afraid of occasioning some shock by declaring my identity .
" Yet , " said she , " I am afraid it is a mistake : my thoughts deceive me .
I wished to see Jane Eyre , and I fancy a likeness where none exists : besides , in eight years she must be so changed .
" I now gently assured her that I was the person she supposed and desired me to be : and seeing that I was understood , and that her senses were quite collected , I explained how Bessie had sent her husband to fetch me from Thornfield .
" I am very ill , I know , " she said ere long .
" I was trying to turn myself a few minutes since , and find I cannot move a limb .
It is as well I should ease my mind before I die : what we think little of in health , burdens us at such an hour as the present is to me .
Is the nurse here ? or is there no one in the room but you ?
" I assured her we were alone .
" Well , I have twice done you a wrong which I regret now .
One was in breaking the promise which I gave my husband to bring you up as my own child ; the other— " she stopped .
" After all , it is of no great importance , perhaps , " she murmured to herself : " and then I may get better ; and to humble myself so to her is painful .
" She made an effort to alter her position , but failed : her face changed ; she seemed to experience some inward sensation—the precursor , perhaps , of the last pang .
" Well , I must get it over .
Eternity is before me : I had better tell her.—Go to my dressing-case , open it , and take out a letter you will see there .
" I obeyed her directions .
" Read the letter , " she said .
It was short , and thus conceived : — " Madam , —Will you have the goodness to send me the address of my niece , Jane Eyre , and to tell me how she is ?
It is my intention to write shortly and desire her to come to me at Madeira .
Providence has blessed my endeavours to secure a competency ; and as I am unmarried and childless , I wish to adopt her during my life , and bequeath her at my death whatever I may have to leave.—I am , Madam , & c .
, & c .
, " JOHN EYRE , Madeira .
" It was dated three years back .
" Why did I never hear of this ?
" I asked .
" Because I disliked you too fixedly and thoroughly ever to lend a hand in lifting you to prosperity .
I could not forget your conduct to me , Jane—the fury with which you once turned on me ; the tone in which you declared you abhorred me the worst of anybody in the world ; the unchildlike look and voice with which you affirmed that the very thought of me made you sick , and asserted that I had treated you with miserable cruelty .
I could not forget my own sensations when you thus started up and poured out the venom of your mind : I felt fear as if an animal that I had struck or pushed had looked up at me with human eyes and cursed me in a man 's voice.—Bring me some water !
Oh , make haste !
" " Dear Mrs. Reed , " said I , as I offered her the draught she required , " think no more of all this , let it pass away from your mind .
Forgive me for my passionate language : I was a child then ; eight , nine years have passed since that day .
" She heeded nothing of what I said ; but when she had tasted the water and drawn breath , she went on thus— " I tell you I could not forget it ; and I took my revenge : for you to be adopted by your uncle , and placed in a state of ease and comfort , was what I could not endure .
I wrote to him ;
I said I was sorry for his disappointment , but Jane Eyre was dead : she had died of typhus fever at Lowood .
Now act as you please : write and contradict my assertion—expose my falsehood as soon as you like .
You were born , I think , to be my torment : my last hour is racked by the recollection of a deed which , but for you , I should never have been tempted to commit .
" " If you could but be persuaded to think no more of it , aunt , and to regard me with kindness and forgiveness " " You have a very bad disposition , " said she , " and one to this day I feel it impossible to understand : how for nine years you could be patient and quiescent under any treatment , and in the tenth break out all fire and violence , I can never comprehend .
" " My disposition is not so bad as you think : I am passionate , but not vindictive .
Many a time , as a little child , I should have been glad to love you if you would have let me ; and I long earnestly to be reconciled to you now : kiss me , aunt .
" I approached my cheek to her lips : she would not touch it .
She said I oppressed her by leaning over the bed , and again demanded water .
As I laid her down—for I raised her and supported her on my arm while she drank—I covered her ice-cold and clammy hand with mine : the feeble fingers shrank from my touch—the glazing eyes shunned my gaze .
" Love me , then , or hate me , as you will , " I said at last , " you have my full and free forgiveness : ask now for God 's , and be at peace .
" Poor , suffering woman ! it was too late for her to make now the effort to change her habitual frame of mind : living , she had ever hated me—dying , she must hate me still .
The nurse now entered , and Bessie followed .
I yet lingered half-an-hour longer , hoping to see some sign of amity : but she gave none .
She was fast relapsing into stupor ; nor did her mind again rally : at twelve o 'clock that night she died .
I was not present to close her eyes , nor were either of her daughters .
They came to tell us the next morning that all was over .
She was by that time laid out .
Eliza and I went to look at her : Georgiana , who had burst out into loud weeping , said she dared not go .
There was stretched Sarah Reed 's once robust and active frame , rigid and still : her eye of flint was covered with its cold lid ; her brow and strong traits wore yet the impress of her inexorable soul .
A strange and solemn object was that corpse to me .
I gazed on it with gloom and pain : nothing soft , nothing sweet , nothing pitying , or hopeful , or subduing did it inspire ; only a grating anguish for _ her _ woes—not _ my _ loss—and a sombre tearless dismay at the fearfulness of death in such a form .
Eliza surveyed her parent calmly .
After a silence of some minutes she observed— " With her constitution she should have lived to a good old age : her life was shortened by trouble .
" And then a spasm constricted her mouth for an instant : as it passed away she turned and left the room , and so did I. Neither of us had dropt a tear .
Mr. Rochester had given me but one week 's leave of absence : yet a month elapsed before I quitted Gateshead .
I wished to leave immediately after the funeral , but Georgiana entreated me to stay till she could get off to London , whither she was now at last invited by her uncle , Mr. Gibson , who had come down to direct his sister 's interment and settle the family affairs .
Georgiana said she dreaded being left alone with Eliza ; from her she got neither sympathy in her dejection , support in her fears , nor aid in her preparations ; so I bore with her feeble-minded wailings and selfish lamentations as well as I could , and did my best in sewing for her and packing her dresses .
It is true , that while I worked , she would idle ; and I thought to myself , " If you and I were destined to live always together , cousin , we would commence matters on a different footing .
I should not settle tamely down into being the forbearing party ;
I should assign you your share of labour , and compel you to accomplish it , or else it should be left undone : I should insist , also , on your keeping some of those drawling , half-insincere complaints hushed in your own breast .
It is only because our connection happens to be very transitory , and comes at a peculiarly mournful season , that I consent thus to render it so patient and compliant on my part .
" At last I saw Georgiana off ; but now it was Eliza 's turn to request me to stay another week .
Her plans required all her time and attention , she said ; she was about to depart for some unknown bourne ; and all day long she stayed in her own room , her door bolted within , filling trunks , emptying drawers , burning papers , and holding no communication with any one .
She wished me to look after the house , to see callers , and answer notes of condolence .
One morning she told me I was at liberty .
" And , " she added , " I am obliged to you for your valuable services and discreet conduct !
There is some difference between living with such an one as you and with Georgiana : you perform your own part in life and burden no one .
To-morrow , " she continued , " I set out for the Continent .
I shall take up my abode in a religious house near Lisle—a nunnery you would call it ; there I shall be quiet and unmolested .
I shall devote myself for a time to the examination of the Roman Catholic dogmas , and to a careful study of the workings of their system : if I find it to be , as I half suspect it is , the one best calculated to ensure the doing of all things decently and in order , I shall embrace the tenets of Rome and probably take the veil .
" I neither expressed surprise at this resolution nor attempted to dissuade her from it .
When we parted , she said : " Good-bye , cousin Jane Eyre ; I wish you well : you have some sense .
" I then returned : " You are not without sense , cousin Eliza ; but what you have , I suppose , in another year will be walled up alive in a French convent .
However , it is not my business , and so it suits you , I don 't much care .
" " You are in the right , " said she ; and with these words we each went our separate way .
As I shall not have occasion to refer either to her or her sister again , I may as well mention here , that Georgiana made an advantageous match with a wealthy worn-out man of fashion , and that Eliza actually took the veil , and is at this day superior of the convent where she passed the period of her novitiate , and which she endowed with her fortune .
My journey seemed tedious—very tedious : fifty miles one day , a night spent at an inn ; fifty miles the next day .
During the first twelve hours I thought of Mrs. Reed in her last moments ; I saw her disfigured and discoloured face , and heard her strangely altered voice .
I mused on the funeral day , the coffin , the hearse , the black train of tenants and servants—few was the number of relatives—the gaping vault , the silent church , the solemn service .
Then I thought of Eliza and Georgiana ;
I beheld one the cynosure of a ball-room , the other the inmate of a convent cell ; and I dwelt on and analysed their separate peculiarities of person and character .
The evening arrival at the great town of—scattered these thoughts ; night gave them quite another turn : laid down on my traveller 's bed , I left reminiscence for anticipation .
I was going back to Thornfield : but how long was I to stay there ?
Not long ; of that I was sure .
I had heard from Mrs. Fairfax in the interim of my absence : the party at the hall was dispersed ;
Mr. Rochester had left for London three weeks ago , but he was then expected to return in a fortnight .
Mrs. Fairfax surmised that he was gone to make arrangements for his wedding , as he had talked of purchasing a new carriage : she said the idea of his marrying Miss Ingram still seemed strange to her ; but from what everybody said , and from what she had herself seen , she could no longer doubt that the event would shortly take place .
" You would be strangely incredulous if you did doubt it , " was my mental comment . " I don 't doubt it .
" The question followed , " Where was I to go ?
" I dreamt of Miss Ingram all the night : in a vivid morning dream I saw her closing the gates of Thornfield against me and pointing me out another road ; and Mr. Rochester looked on with his arms folded—smiling sardonically , as it seemed , at both her and me .
I had not notified to Mrs. Fairfax the exact day of my return ; for I did not wish either car or carriage to meet me at Millcote .
I proposed to walk the distance quietly by myself ; and very quietly , after leaving my box in the ostler 's care , did I slip away from the George Inn , about six o 'clock of a June evening , and take the old road to Thornfield : a road which lay chiefly through fields , and was now little frequented .
I felt glad as the road shortened before me : so glad that I stopped once to ask myself what that joy meant : and to remind reason that it was not to my home I was going , or to a permanent resting-place , or to a place where fond friends looked out for me and waited my arrival .
" Mrs. Fairfax will smile you a calm welcome , to be sure , " said I ; " and little Adele will clap her hands and jump to see you : but you know very well you are thinking of another than they , and that he is not thinking of you .
" But what is so headstrong as youth ?
What so blind as inexperience ?
These affirmed that it was pleasure enough to have the privilege of again looking on Mr. Rochester , whether he looked on me or not ; and they added— " Hasten ! hasten ! be with him while you may : but a few more days or weeks , at most , and you are parted from him for ever !
" And then I strangled a new-born agony—a deformed thing which I could not persuade myself to own and rear—and ran on .
They are making hay , too , in Thornfield meadows : or rather , the labourers are just quitting their work , and returning home with their rakes on their shoulders , now , at the hour I arrive .
I have but a field or two to traverse , and then I shall cross the road and reach the gates .
How full the hedges are of roses !
But I have no time to gather any ; I want to be at the house .
I passed a tall briar , shooting leafy and flowery branches across the path ;
I see the narrow stile with stone steps ; and I see—Mr . Rochester sitting there , a book and a pencil in his hand ; he is writing .
Well , he is not a ghost ; yet every nerve I have is unstrung : for a moment I am beyond my own mastery .
What does it mean ?
I did not think I should tremble in this way when I saw him , or lose my voice or the power of motion in his presence .
I will go back as soon as I can stir : I need not make an absolute fool of myself .
I know another way to the house .
It does not signify if I knew twenty ways ; for he has seen me .
" Hillo !
" he cries ; and he puts up his book and his pencil .
" There you are !
Come on , if you please .
" I suppose I do come on ; though in what fashion I know not ; being scarcely cognisant of my movements , and solicitous only to appear calm ; and , above all , to control the working muscles of my face—which I feel rebel insolently against my will , and struggle to express what I had resolved to conceal .
But I have a veil—it is down : I may make shift yet to behave with decent composure .
" And this is Jane Eyre ?
Are you coming from Millcote , and on foot ?
Yes—just one of your tricks : not to send for a carriage , and come clattering over street and road like a common mortal , but to steal into the vicinage of your home along with twilight , just as if you were a dream or a shade .
What the deuce have you done with yourself this last month ?
" " I have been with my aunt , sir , who is dead .
" " A true Janian reply !
Good angels be my guard !
She comes from the other world—from the abode of people who are dead ; and tells me so when she meets me alone here in the gloaming !
If I dared , I 'd touch you , to see if you are substance or shadow , you elf ! —but I 'd as soon offer to take hold of a blue _ ignis fatuus _ light in a marsh .
Truant ! truant !
" he added , when he had paused an instant .
" Absent from me a whole month , and forgetting me quite , I 'll be sworn !
" I knew there would be pleasure in meeting my master again , even though broken by the fear that he was so soon to cease to be my master , and by the knowledge that I was nothing to him : but there was ever in Mr. Rochester ( so at least I thought ) such a wealth of the power of communicating happiness , that to taste but of the crumbs he scattered to stray and stranger birds like me , was to feast genially .
His last words were balm : they seemed to imply that it imported something to him whether I forgot him or not .
And he had spoken of Thornfield as my home—would that it were my home !
I inquired soon if he had not been to London .
" Yes ; I suppose you found that out by second-sight .
" " Mrs. Fairfax told me in a letter .
" " And did she inform you what I went to do ?
" " Oh , yes , sir !
Everybody knew your errand .
" " You must see the carriage , Jane , and tell me if you don 't think it will suit Mrs. Rochester exactly ; and whether she won 't look like Queen Boadicea , leaning back against those purple cushions .
I wish , Jane , I were a trifle better adapted to match with her externally .
Tell me now , fairy as you are—can 't you give me a charm , or a philter , or something of that sort , to make me a handsome man ?
" " It would be past the power of magic , sir ;
" and , in thought , I added , " A loving eye is all the charm needed : to such you are handsome enough ; or rather your sternness has a power beyond beauty .
" Mr. Rochester had sometimes read my unspoken thoughts with an acumen to me incomprehensible : in the present instance he took no notice of my abrupt vocal response ; but he smiled at me with a certain smile he had of his own , and which he used but on rare occasions .
He seemed to think it too good for common purposes : it was the real sunshine of feeling—he shed it over me now .
" Pass , Janet , " said he , making room for me to cross the stile : " go up home , and stay your weary little wandering feet at a friend 's threshold .
" All I had now to do was to obey him in silence : no need for me to colloquise further .
I got over the stile without a word , and meant to leave him calmly .
An impulse held me fast—a force turned me round .
I said—or something in me said for me , and in spite of me— " Thank you , Mr. Rochester , for your great kindness .
I am strangely glad to get back again to you : and wherever you are is my home—my only home .
" I walked on so fast that even he could hardly have overtaken me had he tried .
Little Adele was half wild with delight when she saw me .
Mrs. Fairfax received me with her usual plain friendliness .
Leah smiled , and even Sophie bid me " bon soir " with glee .
This was very pleasant ; there is no happiness like that of being loved by your fellow-creatures , and feeling that your presence is an addition to their comfort .
I that evening shut my eyes resolutely against the future : I stopped my cars against the voice that kept warning me of near separation and coming grief .
When tea was over and Mrs. Fairfax had taken her knitting , and I had assumed a low seat near her , and Adele , kneeling on the carpet , had nestled close up to me , and a sense of mutual affection seemed to surround us with a ring of golden peace , I uttered a silent prayer that we might not be parted far or soon ; but when , as we thus sat , Mr. Rochester entered , unannounced , and looking at us , seemed to take pleasure in the spectacle of a group so amicable—when he said he supposed the old lady was all right now that she had got her adopted daughter back again , and added that he saw Adele was " prete a croquer sa petite maman Anglaise " —I half ventured to hope that he would , even after his marriage , keep us together somewhere under the shelter of his protection , and not quite exiled from the sunshine of his presence .
A fortnight of dubious calm succeeded my return to Thornfield Hall .
Nothing was said of the master 's marriage , and I saw no preparation going on for such an event .
Almost every day I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had yet heard anything decided : her answer was always in the negative .
Once she said she had actually put the question to Mr. Rochester as to when he was going to bring his bride home ; but he had answered her only by a joke and one of his queer looks , and she could not tell what to make of him .
One thing specially surprised me , and that was , there were no journeyings backward and forward , no visits to Ingram Park : to be sure it was twenty miles off , on the borders of another county ; but what was that distance to an ardent lover ?
To so practised and indefatigable a horseman as Mr. Rochester , it would be but a morning 's ride .
I began to cherish hopes I had no right to conceive : that the match was broken off ; that rumour had been mistaken ; that one or both parties had changed their minds .
I used to look at my master 's face to see if it were sad or fierce ; but I could not remember the time when it had been so uniformly clear of clouds or evil feelings .
If , in the moments I and my pupil spent with him , I lacked spirits and sank into inevitable dejection , he became even gay .
Never had he called me more frequently to his presence ; never been kinder to me when there—and , alas ! never had I loved him so well .
A splendid Midsummer shone over England : skies so pure , suns so radiant as were then seen in long succession , seldom favour even singly , our wave- girt land .
It was as if a band of Italian days had come from the South , like a flock of glorious passenger birds , and lighted to rest them on the cliffs of Albion .
The hay was all got in ; the fields round Thornfield were green and shorn ; the roads white and baked ; the trees were in their dark prime ; hedge and wood , full-leaved and deeply tinted , contrasted well with the sunny hue of the cleared meadows between .
On Midsummer-eve , Adele , weary with gathering wild strawberries in Hay Lane half the day , had gone to bed with the sun .
I watched her drop asleep , and when I left her , I sought the garden .
It was now the sweetest hour of the twenty-four : — " Day its fervid fires had wasted , " and dew fell cool on panting plain and scorched summit .
Where the sun had gone down in simple state—pure of the pomp of clouds—spread a solemn purple , burning with the light of red jewel and furnace flame at one point , on one hill-peak , and extending high and wide , soft and still softer , over half heaven .
The east had its own charm or fine deep blue , and its own modest gem , a casino and solitary star : soon it would boast the moon ; but she was yet beneath the horizon .
I walked a while on the pavement ; but a subtle , well-known scent—that of a cigar—stole from some window ; I saw the library casement open a handbreadth ; I knew I might be watched thence ; so I went apart into the orchard .
No nook in the grounds more sheltered and more Eden-like ; it was full of trees , it bloomed with flowers : a very high wall shut it out from the court , on one side ; on the other , a beech avenue screened it from the lawn .
At the bottom was a sunk fence ; its sole separation from lonely fields : a winding walk , bordered with laurels and terminating in a giant horse-chestnut , circled at the base by a seat , led down to the fence .
Here one could wander unseen .
While such honey-dew fell , such silence reigned , such gloaming gathered , I felt as if I could haunt such shade for ever ; but in threading the flower and fruit parterres at the upper part of the enclosure , enticed there by the light the now rising moon cast on this more open quarter , my step is stayed—not by sound , not by sight , but once more by a warning fragrance .
Sweet-briar and southernwood , jasmine , pink , and rose have long been yielding their evening sacrifice of incense : this new scent is neither of shrub nor flower ; it is—I know it well—it is Mr. Rochester 's cigar .
I look round and I listen .
I see trees laden with ripening fruit .
I hear a nightingale warbling in a wood half a mile off ; no moving form is visible , no coming step audible ; but that perfume increases : I must flee .
I make for the wicket leading to the shrubbery , and I see Mr. Rochester entering .
I step aside into the ivy recess ; he will not stay long : he will soon return whence he came , and if I sit still he will never see me .
But no—eventide is as pleasant to him as to me , and this antique garden as attractive ; and he strolls on , now lifting the gooseberry-tree branches to look at the fruit , large as plums , with which they are laden ; now taking a ripe cherry from the wall ; now stooping towards a knot of flowers , either to inhale their fragrance or to admire the dew-beads on their petals .
A great moth goes humming by me ; it alights on a plant at Mr. Rochester 's foot : he sees it , and bends to examine it .
" Now , he has his back towards me , " thought I , " and he is occupied too ; perhaps , if I walk softly , I can slip away unnoticed .
" I trode on an edging of turf that the crackle of the pebbly gravel might not betray me : he was standing among the beds at a yard or two distant from where I had to pass ; the moth apparently engaged him .
" I shall get by very well , " I meditated .
As I crossed his shadow , thrown long over the garden by the moon , not yet risen high , he said quietly , without turning— " Jane , come and look at this fellow .
" I had made no noise : he had not eyes behind—could his shadow feel ?
I started at first , and then I approached him .
" Look at his wings , " said he , " he reminds me rather of a West Indian insect ; one does not often see so large and gay a night-rover in England ; there ! he is flown .
" The moth roamed away .
I was sheepishly retreating also ; but Mr. Rochester followed me , and when we reached the wicket , he said— " Turn back : on so lovely a night it is a shame to sit in the house ; and surely no one can wish to go to bed while sunset is thus at meeting with moonrise .
" It is one of my faults , that though my tongue is sometimes prompt enough at an answer , there are times when it sadly fails me in framing an excuse ; and always the lapse occurs at some crisis , when a facile word or plausible pretext is specially wanted to get me out of painful embarrassment .
I did not like to walk at this hour alone with Mr. Rochester in the shadowy orchard ; but I could not find a reason to allege for leaving him .
I followed with lagging step , and thoughts busily bent on discovering a means of extrication ; but he himself looked so composed and so grave also , I became ashamed of feeling any confusion : the evil—if evil existent or prospective there was—seemed to lie with me only ; his mind was unconscious and quiet .
" Jane , " he recommenced , as we entered the laurel walk , and slowly strayed down in the direction of the sunk fence and the horse-chestnut , " Thornfield is a pleasant place in summer , is it not ?
" " Yes , sir .
" " You must have become in some degree attached to the house , —you , who have an eye for natural beauties , and a good deal of the organ of Adhesiveness ?
" " I am attached to it , indeed .
" " And though I don 't comprehend how it is , I perceive you have acquired a degree of regard for that foolish little child Adele , too ; and even for simple dame Fairfax ?
" " Yes , sir ; in different ways , I have an affection for both .
" " And would be sorry to part with them ?
" " Yes .
" " Pity !
" he said , and sighed and paused .
" It is always the way of events in this life , " he continued presently : " no sooner have you got settled in a pleasant resting-place , than a voice calls out to you to rise and move on , for the hour of repose is expired .
" " Must I move on , sir ?
" I asked .
" Must I leave Thornfield ?
" " I believe you must , Jane .
I am sorry , Janet , but I believe indeed you must .
" This was a blow : but I did not let it prostrate me .
" Well , sir , I shall be ready when the order to march comes .
" " It is come now—I must give it to-night .
" " Then you _ are _ going to be married , sir ?
" " Ex-act-ly—pre-cise-ly : with your usual acuteness , you have hit the nail straight on the head .
" " Soon , sir ?
" " Very soon , my—that is , Miss Eyre : and you 'll remember , Jane , the first time I , or Rumour , plainly intimated to you that it was my intention to put my old bachelor 's neck into the sacred noose , to enter into the holy estate of matrimony—to take Miss Ingram to my bosom , in short ( she 's an extensive armful : but that 's not to the point—one can 't have too much of such a very excellent thing as my beautiful Blanche ) : well , as I was saying—listen to me , Jane !
You 're not turning your head to look after more moths , are you ?
That was only a lady-clock , child , ' flying away home .
' I wish to remind you that it was you who first said to me , with that discretion I respect in you—with that foresight , prudence , and humility which befit your responsible and dependent position—that in case I married Miss Ingram , both you and little Adele had better trot forthwith .
I pass over the sort of slur conveyed in this suggestion on the character of my beloved ; indeed , when you are far away , Janet , I 'll try to forget it : I shall notice only its wisdom ; which is such that I have made it my law of action .
Adele must go to school ; and you , Miss Eyre , must get a new situation .
" " In about a month I hope to be a bridegroom , " continued Mr. Rochester ;
" and in the interim , I shall myself look out for employment and an asylum for you .
" " Thank you , sir ;
I am sorry to give— " " Oh , no need to apologise !
I consider that when a dependent does her duty as well as you have done yours , she has a sort of claim upon her employer for any little assistance he can conveniently render her ; indeed I have already , through my future mother-in-law , heard of a place that I think will suit : it is to undertake the education of the five daughters of Mrs. Dionysius O 'Gall of Bitternutt Lodge , Connaught , Ireland .
You 'll like Ireland , I think : they 're such warm-hearted people there , they say .
" " It is a long way off , sir .
" " No matter—a girl of your sense will not object to the voyage or the distance .
" " Not the voyage , but the distance : and then the sea is a barrier— " " From what , Jane ?
" " From England and from Thornfield : and— " " Well ?
" " From _ you _ , sir .
" I said this almost involuntarily , and , with as little sanction of free will , my tears gushed out .
I did not cry so as to be heard , however ; I avoided sobbing .
The thought of Mrs. O 'Gall and Bitternutt Lodge struck cold to my heart ; and colder the thought of all the brine and foam , destined , as it seemed , to rush between me and the master at whose side I now walked , and coldest the remembrance of the wider ocean—wealth , caste , custom intervened between me and what I naturally and inevitably loved .
" It is a long way , " I again said .
" It is , to be sure ; and when you get to Bitternutt Lodge , Connaught , Ireland , I shall never see you again , Jane : that 's morally certain .
I never go over to Ireland , not having myself much of a fancy for the country .
We have been good friends , Jane ; have we not ?
" " Yes , sir .
" " And when friends are on the eve of separation , they like to spend the little time that remains to them close to each other .
Come ! we 'll talk over the voyage and the parting quietly half-an-hour or so , while the stars enter into their shining life up in heaven yonder : here is the chestnut tree : here is the bench at its old roots .
Come , we will sit there in peace to-night , though we should never more be destined to sit there together .
" He seated me and himself .
" It is a long way to Ireland , Janet , and I am sorry to send my little friend on such weary travels : but if I can 't do better , how is it to be helped ?
Are you anything akin to me , do you think , Jane ?
" I could risk no sort of answer by this time : my heart was still .
" Because , " he said , " I sometimes have a queer feeling with regard to you—especially when you are near me , as now : it is as if I had a string somewhere under my left ribs , tightly and inextricably knotted to a similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little frame .
And if that boisterous Channel , and two hundred miles or so of land come broad between us , I am afraid that cord of communion will be snapt ; and then I 've a nervous notion I should take to bleeding inwardly .
" That I _ never _ should , sir : you know— " Impossible to proceed .
" Jane , do you hear that nightingale singing in the wood ?
Listen !
" In listening , I sobbed convulsively ; for I could repress what I endured no longer ; I was obliged to yield , and I was shaken from head to foot with acute distress .
When I did speak , it was only to express an impetuous wish that I had never been born , or never come to Thornfield .
" Because you are sorry to leave it ?
" The vehemence of emotion , stirred by grief and love within me , was claiming mastery , and struggling for full sway , and asserting a right to predominate , to overcome , to live , rise , and reign at last : yes , —and to speak .
" I grieve to leave Thornfield : I love Thornfield : —I love it , because I have lived in it a full and delightful life , —momentarily at least .
I have not been trampled on .
I have not been petrified .
I have not been buried with inferior minds , and excluded from every glimpse of communion with what is bright and energetic and high .
I have talked , face to face , with what I reverence , with what I delight in , —with an original , a vigorous , an expanded mind .
I have known you , Mr. Rochester ; and it strikes me with terror and anguish to feel I absolutely must be torn from you for ever .
I see the necessity of departure ; and it is like looking on the necessity of death .
" " Where do you see the necessity ?
" he asked suddenly .
" Where ?
You , sir , have placed it before me .
" " In what shape ?
" " In the shape of Miss Ingram ; a noble and beautiful woman , —your bride .
" " My bride !
What bride ?
I have no bride !
" " But you will have .
" " Yes ; —I will ! —I will !
" He set his teeth .
" Then I must go : —you have said it yourself .
" " No : you must stay !
I swear it—and the oath shall be kept .
" " I tell you I must go ! " I retorted , roused to something like passion .
" Do you think I can stay to become nothing to you ?
Do you think I am an automaton ? —a machine without feelings ? and can bear to have my morsel of bread snatched from my lips , and my drop of living water dashed from my cup ?
Do you think , because I am poor , obscure , plain , and little , I am soulless and heartless ?
You think wrong !
—I have as much soul as you , —and full as much heart !
And if God had gifted me with some beauty and much wealth , I should have made it as hard for you to leave me , as it is now for me to leave you .
I am not talking to you now through the medium of custom , conventionalities , nor even of mortal flesh ; —it is my spirit that addresses your spirit ; just as if both had passed through the grave , and we stood at God 's feet , equal , —as we are !
" " As we are !
" repeated Mr. Rochester— " so , " he added , enclosing me in his arms . Gathering me to his breast , pressing his lips on my lips : " so , Jane !
" " Yes , so , sir , " I rejoined : " and yet not so ; for you are a married man—or as good as a married man , and wed to one inferior to you—to one with whom you have no sympathy—whom I do not believe you truly love ; for I have seen and heard you sneer at her .
I would scorn such a union : therefore I am better than you—let me go !
" " Where , Jane ?
To Ireland ?
" " Yes—to Ireland .
I have spoken my mind , and can go anywhere now .
" " Jane , be still ; don 't struggle so , like a wild frantic bird that is rending its own plumage in its desperation .
" " I am no bird ; and no net ensnares me ;
I am a free human being with an independent will , which I now exert to leave you .
" Another effort set me at liberty , and I stood erect before him .
" And your will shall decide your destiny , " he said : " I offer you my hand , my heart , and a share of all my possessions .
" " You play a farce , which I merely laugh at .
" " I ask you to pass through life at my side—to be my second self , and best earthly companion .
" " For that fate you have already made your choice , and must abide by it .
" " Jane , be still a few moments : you are over-excited : I will be still too .
" A waft of wind came sweeping down the laurel-walk , and trembled through the boughs of the chestnut : it wandered away—away—to an indefinite distance—it died .
The nightingale 's song was then the only voice of the hour : in listening to it , I again wept .
Mr. Rochester sat quiet , looking at me gently and seriously .
Some time passed before he spoke ; he at last said— " Come to my side , Jane , and let us explain and understand one another .
" " I will never again come to your side : I am torn away now , and cannot return .
" " But , Jane , I summon you as my wife : it is you only I intend to marry .
" I was silent : I thought he mocked me .
" Come , Jane—come hither .
" " Your bride stands between us .
" He rose , and with a stride reached me .
" My bride is here , " he said , again drawing me to him , " because my equal is here , and my likeness .
Jane , will you marry me ?
" Still I did not answer , and still I writhed myself from his grasp : for I was still incredulous .
" Do you doubt me , Jane ?
" " Entirely .
" " You have no faith in me ?
" " Not a whit .
" " Am I a liar in your eyes ?
" he asked passionately .
" Little sceptic , you _ shall _ be convinced .
What love have I for Miss Ingram ?
None : and that you know .
What love has she for me ?
None : as I have taken pains to prove : I caused a rumour to reach her that my fortune was not a third of what was supposed , and after that I presented myself to see the result ; it was coldness both from her and her mother .
I would not—I could not—marry Miss Ingram .
You—you strange , you almost unearthly thing !
—I love as my own flesh .
You—poor and obscure , and small and plain as you are—I entreat to accept me as a husband .
" " What , me !
" I ejaculated , beginning in his earnestness—and especially in his incivility—to credit his sincerity : " me who have not a friend in the world but you—if you are my friend : not a shilling but what you have given me ?
" " You , Jane , I must have you for my own—entirely my own .
Will you be mine ?
Say yes , quickly .
" " Mr. Rochester , let me look at your face : turn to the moonlight .
" " Why ?
" " Because I want to read your countenance—turn !
" " There ! you will find it scarcely more legible than a crumpled , scratched page .
Read on : only make haste , for I suffer .
" His face was very much agitated and very much flushed , and there were strong workings in the features , and strange gleams in the eyes .
" Oh , Jane , you torture me !
" he exclaimed .
" With that searching and yet faithful and generous look , you torture me !
" " How can I do that ?
If you are true , and your offer real , my only feelings to you must be gratitude and devotion—they cannot torture .
" " Gratitude !
" he ejaculated ; and added wildly— " Jane accept me quickly .
Say , Edward—give me my name—Edward—I will marry you .
" " Are you in earnest ?
Do you truly love me ?
Do you sincerely wish me to be your wife ?
" " I do ; and if an oath is necessary to satisfy you , I swear it .
" " Then , sir , I will marry you .
" " Edward—my little wife !
" " Dear Edward !
" " Come to me—come to me entirely now , " said he ; and added , in his deepest tone , speaking in my ear as his cheek was laid on mine , " Make my happiness—I will make yours .
" And if I had loved him less I should have thought his accent and look of exultation savage ; but , sitting by him , roused from the nightmare of parting—called to the paradise of union—I thought only of the bliss given me to drink in so abundant a flow .
Again and again he said , " Are you happy , Jane ?
" And again and again I answered , " Yes .
" Will I not guard , and cherish , and solace her ?
Is there not love in my heart , and constancy in my resolves ?
It will expiate at God 's tribunal .
I know my Maker sanctions what I do .
For the world 's judgment—I wash my hands thereof .
For man 's opinion—I defy it .
" But what had befallen the night ?
The moon was not yet set , and we were all in shadow : I could scarcely see my master 's face , near as I was .
And what ailed the chestnut tree ? it writhed and groaned ; while wind roared in the laurel walk , and came sweeping over us .
" We must go in , " said Mr. Rochester : " the weather changes . I could have sat with thee till morning , Jane .
" " And so , " thought I , " could I with you .
" I should have said so , perhaps , but a livid , vivid spark leapt out of a cloud at which I was looking , and there was a crack , a crash , and a close rattling peal ; and I thought only of hiding my dazzled eyes against Mr. Rochester 's shoulder .
The rain rushed down .
He hurried me up the walk , through the grounds , and into the house ; but we were quite wet before we could pass the threshold .
He was taking off my shawl in the hall , and shaking the water out of my loosened hair , when Mrs. Fairfax emerged from her room .
I did not observe her at first , nor did Mr. Rochester .
The lamp was lit .
The clock was on the stroke of twelve .
" Hasten to take off your wet things , " said he ;
" and before you go , good- night—good-night , my darling !
" He kissed me repeatedly .
When I looked up , on leaving his arms , there stood the widow , pale , grave , and amazed .
I only smiled at her , and ran upstairs .
" Explanation will do for another time , " thought I. Still , when I reached my chamber , I felt a pang at the idea she should even temporarily misconstrue what she had seen .
But joy soon effaced every other feeling ; and loud as the wind blew , near and deep as the thunder crashed , fierce and frequent as the lightning gleamed , cataract-like as the rain fell during a storm of two hours ' duration , I experienced no fear and little awe .
Mr. Rochester came thrice to my door in the course of it , to ask if I was safe and tranquil : and that was comfort , that was strength for anything .
Before I left my bed in the morning , little Adele came running in to tell me that the great horse-chestnut at the bottom of the orchard had been struck by lightning in the night , and half of it split away .
